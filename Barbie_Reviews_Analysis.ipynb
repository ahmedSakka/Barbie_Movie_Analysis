      "['Margot does the best with what she\\'s given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.', \"The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!\", 'As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain\\'t the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie\\'s solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn\\'t the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don\\'t add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.', \"I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\", \"I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.\", \"Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\", 'I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can\\'t be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you\\'ve watched anything made in the past 15 years you\\'ll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it\\'s so awkward that it\\'s funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it\\'s staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie\\'s Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It\\'s given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.', \"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!\", \"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).\", \"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.\", \"I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.\", \"The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.\", \"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\", \"I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.\", \"I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\", \"My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.\", 'I do not usually write reviews, but this is beyond description. Last time I wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time. This is almost as bad. At least Gosling plays his part well, but the story is abysmal. If you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry, then yes please do. You will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow ..... nearly two hours long this was mind-numbing storytelling at its mediocre worst. How many ways can I say do not go see it if you have a choice. See anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated self-importance. If I could give it negative 10 stars I would.', 'This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from \"Barbieland\" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling\\'s portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you\\'re not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.', \"I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.\", 'My Review - Barbie\\nIn Cinemas now\\nMy Rating 6.5/10I\\'ve been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I\\'m a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig\\'s work.I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I\\'d love it or a huge disappointment and I\\'d loathe it in other words no in between for me.How ever that\\'s not the case I didn\\'t love it and I didn\\'t loathe it I have to accept that I\\njust didn\\'t get it ?Perhaps it\\'s because that I\\'m a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won\\'t see Barbie.The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn\\'t and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken\\'s behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it\\'s popular for the creators of the movie I\\'m left puzzled at what audience it\\'s aimed at ?The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn\\'t see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric\\'s 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .It\\'s one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig\\'s clever perhaps to clever script.Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying \"that the film\\'s aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences \"the thing you didn\\'t know you wanted.I\\'m not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn\\'t reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn\\'t know I wanted wasn\\'t what I wanted at all.Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named \"Techni-Barbie,\" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It\\'s a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,', 'I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It\\'s preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can\\'t we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end. By the time they were talking about ordinary Barbie, all I could think was \"Sanctimonious Barbie.\"', 'Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.', \"I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.\", 'I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of the movie. It was very upbeat, positive and light. However, things soon became negative about 20 - 25 minutes into the movie. I couldn\\'t stand it. Barbie\\'s world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken\\'s attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the \"conflict\" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn\\'t need to go that way, that far, that fast. I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs. This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict.', \"This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me? I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.\", \"Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.\", 'Let me start by saying that I\\'m by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It\\'s clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner\\'s feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person\\'s life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)\\nI can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the \"not taking itself serious\" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.', 'I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!I was a little bit nervous when I heard this was not going to be an in-universe thing and that Barbie would enter the real world, but that was a great story.The real-life story did give the art direction the purpose of making a \"BarbieLand\" with life size dream houses even I wanted to live in. The film just looks really good.Give praise to director Greta Gerwig because this movie is fun but there were a lot of deep life cuts and the balance between the two was perfect.It was good hands down.', 'Yes. Day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else. Ok, Barbie itself was not a creative idea, I know. And actually I didn\\'t expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place, all in all it\\'s \"Barbie\".But wouldn\\'t you agree with me in that it could have been excelled better? It totally could have been. This movie has a huge budget. Then why such a mediocre story at best? I\\'m not saying it was a bad movie as well, but it was just \"ok\". Just that.Nowadays movies have become nothing else but live-actions, sequels and prequels. Now it seems like the only thing matters is to have known faces in your movie and the promotions; and creating a story and excelling it good became the least important components of a movie. Unfortunately, Barbie does not fall short in these criterias.', 'Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.', \"The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.It started off quite funny, but after 45 minutes or so, the movie went in a direction I did not like. It took itself a bit too serious. I would have preferred a more lighthearted movie.Ryan Gosling did the best job out of everyone playing Ken I thought. The perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy, girly and insecure. Job well done, especially toward the end.If you are a fan of Barbie, you will probably get your money's worth.\", 'Its like watching at \"Truman\\'s show\" but all the set it\\'s pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas. I grew up with barbie dolls and I felt very disappointed, I was expecting a different kind of story, the ending was the worst. I think the message should be more with the real feminist concept of Simone de Bouvoir, we all deserve the same rights. In the end Instead of just Barbie Land they should changed as; Barbie and Ken Land.Definitely is not the best movie of Greta.I enjoyed the music, the set and loved the clothes. Although I excepted to hear the Aqua song! Why it wasn\\'t played in the movie.Anyway its not a bad movie, it\\'s just good movie.', 'This is an odd movie. On the one hand the presentation of the Barbie world... and Mattel making fun of itself... is fantastic.But on the theme / plot / moral of the story side, all I came up with is a big \"What?\". The Barbies are initially presented as real life dolls who all have vital roles in society, but in reality are scripted airheads who live the same life every day. The Kens are presented as bumbling fools who live only to grovel at the feet of the Barbies. Which is kind of how the toys really are, I guess. I can get the satire.But then we get further into the movie, and the Kens become pompous overlords and the Barbies mysteriously, for no reason whatsoever, turn into Ken-worshippers without a real purpose of their own.Somehow this is all supposed to represent masculine vs feminine roles in real life, but in truth don\\'t accurately represent either. The movie presents a real world in which all men are successful and in charge and all women are subjected and repressed. While that does exist, are there no female doctors, attorneys, real estate moguls, business owners, etc etc?The movie presents this as extremes, and doesn\\'t really do a very good job of it. About 2/3 of the way through, I can\\'t tell whether the movie is against sexism or promoting it. The roles of the sexes become clouded... and like so many feminist movies we\\'ve seen, men are presented as idiots and women revert Barbie World right back to its female-dominated status.As a result although semi-brilliant in presentation, the movie is preachy, heavy-handed, bigoted, and loses the element of believe-ability and relevance. I had been told the movie is great... but because of the questionable script it\\'s just so so.I enjoyed it, but in the end wondered exactly what the movie was trying to say? And in the end, the Barbie doll joins the real world? What\\'s that all about? Perhaps they had some hidden meaning there, but I\\'m not sure exactly what it was.I give it 6 stars (better than mediocre) because of the sets, presentation and often enjoyable script lines, but there\\'s a lot of head-scratching when it comes to the point this movie was actually trying to make... if any.', 'The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that\\'s it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the \"bad\" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.The photography is good though. So the average is 5/10\\nIt is another plainly bad movie that is trying to hide behind agenda.', \"But it is also in its smallest details, from the art direction, costumes, and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all Barbie generations and the like. A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood.\", \"I loved barbie growing up, and even at 42 years old I couldn't wait to go see the movie! I didn't have any expectations because I had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie that's for adults and not kids. I adored Barbieland, but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie! It got silly, had no storyline, was overly political and woke, man bashing and made men silly, and I really didn't care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crude.The music is good, but I wasn't prepared for a musical and it became that for some unknown reason at one point.Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show. He looked like he was having the time of his life making this movie!Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie but it wasn't that interesting to watch and I didn't understand why she was being forced to get in the box and what would happen if she did get in.\", 'I Understand that Some People are Going to Have Big Big Problems with Some of the Messaging within this Film.

(Both Guys and Girls)Greta Gerwig Nailed this Thing!I was just sitting Their Watching it and I was like \"Man, I\\'m Actually Enjoying what the hell is going on here\" 🤣Things I Liked About The Film -1.

(Beached off Wasn\\'t Funny, but after That, The Laughs Started Coming in). (4th Wall Ugly Joke, Margot Is the Wrong Example for this, was the Biggest Laugh in the theatre 😆)8. So to Summarise, I Really Liked the Beach Battle, The Dance Scenes, the Plotline, The Comedy, the Tone, The Aesthetics and the Atmosphere in that Theatre whilst Watching this Thing.From what I watched, it was Well Put Together, Well Excecuted and everything Came Together So Well. And that Cherry on Top Quip 🍒🎂 from Margot Robbie was Just 👌Overall, if You have Problems with the Some of the Messaging, You will Not Enjoy it, Bottom Line. (Guys, You don\\'t have to agree or Take any of the Messaging to Heart, just go with it, Become Kenough and Extract that Entertainment Factor For Your Own Enjoyment) (Ladies, Take Some of the Positive Messages From this Film because there are Some Genuinely Positive Messages in Here)', \"BARBIE is a great example of hype over substance. It is laugh out loud at times and Gosling steals every scene he's in. The art direction is on point. What makes it tiresome is THE MESSAGE pummelled into the audience, but then were we expecting any subtly? Probably not. Ultimately my wife just thought, 'I already know this. I don't need to hear it. But maybe some women do?' I get her point. In the end it felt like we were being sold Barbie Dolls as some kind of icon of feminism. But seriously, they are a very poor example of female role models. Not surprisingly Mattel was one of the producers.\", 'It\\'s an incredibly fun movie. Lots of laughs. Very campy over the top humour. But also surprisingly touching. My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don\\'t sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.The soundtrack also works really within the film. I don\\'t know how many of them I would listen to separately. I also wouldnt be suprised if either \"Im just Ken\" or \"What was I made for?\" or both was nominated for an oscar. Speaking of oscars, I think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design, costumes, hair and makeup - because visually this movie is such a treat.Now I dont think all aspects worked for me. I don\\'t think the Mattel/CEO subplot was needed. There could have been another way for her to go back to Barbieland organically. I felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this \"chase scene\" didnt add much. Also, Gloria\\'s (America Ferrera) monologue. Now, dont get me wrong I think there is a lot truth to it. But I just found it somewhat one-note. It didn\\'t exactly blow me away as it has for others. And lastly, I undertstand the importance of having Ruth Handler featured in the movie....just a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in Mattel headquarters.Overall, I would definitely recommend the film. You\\'ll laugh, you\\'ll cry. You\\'ll have fun. This isn\\'t just a movie, it is the moment.', \"Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer. This movie is going to make bank!\", \"I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.\", 'Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we\\'ll catch glimpses of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Truman Show\"; we\\'ll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy\\'s films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it\\'s a lot. \"Barbie\" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today\\'s society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms \"Barbie\" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast \"Real Time\" in which he said: \"Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment\". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that\\'s undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idi*ts, gr*edy, d*mb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig\\'s goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the \"Stereotyped\" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you\\'re a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can\\'t just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn\\'t encompass the mandatory \"diversity and inclusion\" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn\\'t be \"empowering\" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the \"evil patriarchy\". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the \"toxic\" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film\\'s script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile \"conservative fascist\". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the \"evil businessmen\" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria\\'s feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are \"d*mb\". The Barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).\"Barbie\" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.\"Barbie\" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one\\'s social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, Barbie doesn\\'t even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. \"Who is Barbie?\"', \"Barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way! I was taken aback with the 2001 opening, since I have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed, but then it starts to unfold.And what we have is a combination of The Twilight Zone and 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.It really focuses in on one Barbie (Margot Robbie) who finds herself out of her element, and her struggle to comes to terms with herself. Though the film has some weirdness to it, it sets us up for the second half of the film which really shines.And its messages pack a wallop!!!The casting is top notch, starting with Ms. Robbie in the title role. Ryan Gosling also delivers a fantastic performance as well, with a wide range. But one actress truly deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and that is America Ferrara. The other performers are likewise great!I'm also struck by how Mattel allowed itself to be show in a fantasy way that isn't always flattering. And toward the end, we have the Barbie doll's creator, Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman) tell Ms. Robbie's character some facts about herself that are less than flattering. That scene alone is incredibly powerful.And of course, the visuals are something to behold!On the whole, a truly incredible film that has a lot of originality! Highly recommended!\", 'SCORE: 9.5/10Queue the \"Perhaps I treated you too harshly\". I\\'ve seen this movie 6 times now. That is not a mistake and it did not happen on accident. I love this movie and, yes, it\\'s not perfect, but it is way better than I had originally scored it and continued to score it each time I rewatched it. I think on my first watch I just couldn\\'t get over how much of the film I had already seen from the marketing. There was an overwhelming amount of the movie revealed in things leading up to the release. The story is still lacking in some areas, but this genuinely might be the most entertaining movie of all time. The music is mesmerizing, the acting performances are unbelievable, and I never want to stop rewatching it.Also, I like to pick out new things each time I rewatch it. No one is talking about Hockey Barbie. She might have been my favorite. She is drop dead gorgeous.ORIGINAL SCORE: 7.8/10Letterboxd continues to be goated. The pink heart is a nice touch. Maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but could you blame me? The marketing for this movie was undoubtedly some of the best that has ever been done. The film wasn\\'t bad by any stretch of the imagination, but there definitely was a feeling of being underwhelmed, which has to do with a lot of things. First, because the marketing was so amazing, it felt like I had seen 75% of the movie already before stepping foot in the theater. The story is good, but I think it really struggled with straddling the line between being a social commentary and being goofy and funny. It did a decent job of both, but each side hindered the ability for the other to have maximum impact. Because of that, it led to a lot of parts feeling forced, almost in an attempt to balance out the levels at very inopportune times. The timing was slightly off and created a couple awkward stretches where you were waiting for something to be funny, but it ended up being serious for a bit too long.With all that said, I still have a fun time with the premiere, and I\\'m not going to let knowing of all the good parts take away from how good they actually were. The songs were catchy, the vibes were superb, and the cast was amazing. Michael Cera as Allan and his involvement in the story was definitely a nice surprise. However, to no surprise, the stars of the show, me and Margot Robbie...I mean Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie killed it as Ken and Barbie. As a man, I thought the jabs at men were hilarious and warranted. The best type of comedy is relatable comedy, and I think they did a good job with it. The references to other movies were also cool, especially their dig at Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League. The Film Bros are going to HATE this movie. The set pieces for this film were very impressive, and Greta Gerwig seems like an amazing human being.My criticisms of this movie are not to be taken as me being disappointed or even that I didn\\'t like parts of it. I think I just saw the potential this movie had and it flashed it to us occasionally, but ultimately fell short. I am happy to be living in a time where Barbenheimer is happening and we can celebrate cinema together, but I have a feeling that Oppenheimer is going to blow this thing out of the water, no pun intended. If you look at my Perfect Score Ranking, you will see that I am not shy to express my more \"feminine\" side and appreciate movies that maybe most men wouldn\\'t. I was really expecting for this film to be a huge hit for me, but it ended up just being good. Which is okay! I definitely still recommend for people to see it, and I will be jamming to the songs of the soundtrack in my car. Well done Greta and team!', \"BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it's a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.\", \"While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast. I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.\", \"This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie. Anyway, I think it was a crazy and fun event, but it was a bad movie.\", 'The casting for the roles is pretty well spot on. Margot Robbie is an absolute superstar and nobody would fit the role of Barbie better. I liked the little joke when Barbie says \"I\\'m not pretty anymore. I\\'m not \\'stereotypical Barbie\\' pretty and the narrator replies \" Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point.\" Even when they try to make Margot Robbie less pretty they can\\'t really achieve it. Robbie shines with charisma every time she is on a screen and this movie is no exception. Not only is she very attractive but her acting is superb as well.They also found perfect roles for Ryan Gosling and Will Ferrell. The roles fit their skill sets perfectly and made the best of what is overall a pretty unusual and scattered movie. The costumes in the film were also fantastic and probably helped tap into some nostalgia with people who played with Barbie\\'s before.The movies biggest issue in my mind was that it couldn\\'t ever really decide what it was. This led to an inability to achieve any momentum as you aren\\'t sure whether it\\'s going to hit you with silly jokes that were quite funny at times or whether you were supposed to scramble through the social messaging it was also clearly trying to send. The problem is especially clear when the two blurred together. I wasn\\'t sure whether some topics were serious social messages they are trying to advance or to simply be viewed as a joke.The ending made it all even more confusing. I don\\'t mind endings being preachy but it was unclear what the audience is supposed to take away from what went down.Overall I would have preferred if the entire movie was one big comedy , but I suppose the filmmakers knew best since they\\'re the ones raking in the cash right now. Kudos to them. Great Casting but is it Satire or Social Commentary?', \"This fulfills my childhood in a way I could never have anticipated. It reflects upon the flaws of our world and helps us all accept them by also accepting the imperfections in ourselves, like the fact that we are all a little dark and weird and crazy sometimes. And that doesn't make us any less men or women, or whater we are or want to be.It gives agency to all our wildest thoughts by putting the innocence of childhood in the context of the real world that all adolscents must eventually enter. It convinces me that someone out there thinks of the world in the same unique optimistic way as I do. And that's enough. Growing up is mandatory. But it doesn't have to be uncomfortable or ugly. It can ne okay. Thank you Greta Gerwig for this comedy gift.\", 'Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.', 'I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.', \"I was pretty excited to see this film and hope I'm not going to get put on a list for saying I didn't enjoy it that much. The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.\", \"It's a shame you can't give a one word review for this. I mean, why use a nice , delicate 2 fingered nutcracker to break the shell of an idea when there's a perfectly good 50lb sledgehammer right there in the garage. Look , don't beat around the bush here and get all meta on me. Say what you're thinking, and if that doesn't work drum it into me with text book platitudes generated from the central server of GPT. Is this a good film or a bad film? Is it a classic? Will it deconstruct a fantasy world and thus can reflect the modern world and change it all for the better? They say Americans don't do irony. Well that's as maybe be but one thing Hollywood does not do is nuance. This movie sold for the same reason Barbie sold.\", \"It is funny, it is deep, it is nostalgic, it is not about romance, it is all the things the doll was meant to be.The narrator states at the beginning that the reason the doll was conceived was to give girls a path different from motherhood, but somehow we ended up turning her into this shallow stereotype to crush women's self-esteem.The movie is entertaining , it makes you laugh, has so many characters, you barely get to appreciate all of them. I don't particularly love gosling as ken, I find him too old for the role, but plays well the part.Now the important thing about the movie is the concept. The whole idea of patriarchy being the ultimate cause for the existential crisis for both men and women is just beyond brilliant. It is light enough so you don't get an existencial crisis while watching it, but you'll leave the theater with a refreshed notion that we are all suffering due to the same problem.That scene with the old lady is endearing, the scene where barbie and ken are explaining how they are feeling about being observed on the street is an eye opener, and ohh, that final joke! Bonus points for that ending!Will definitely what again.\", \"POSITIVES:1) Ryan Gosling completely steals the film for me. He's hilarious, but also completely sells the emotional moments too. A great performance 2) The film had several moments that made me laugh out loud. A lot of the humour is very clever, as can be expected from these two great writers. I should also say that I think the emotional moments were written very well too, particularly Barbie and Ken's 'breakup' at the end, which I thought was the best scene in the film 3) The production design and costume design were both terrific and will probably win their respective OscarsNEGATIVES:1) There are multiple times where the film was far too goofy for me. Examples include the chase scene in the Mattel headquarters and the car chase scene that follows it 2) The message, whilst respectable in a way, was just far too on the nose for me at times. When it was done subtly it felt clever and interesting, but then when they just did big monologues at the end it just became too over the top 3) The film felt quite dated for me. If this had came out in the 90s or 2000s I feel like it would've been much more impactful and relevant, whereas nowadays not many kids play with Barbie dolls and the male-dominated society is nowhere near as prevalent.\", 'Barbie surprised me in all the best ways. It was funny, moving, inspirational, and all around ridiculously entertaining. I mean that with every sense of the implication to.There were moments that everyone could relate to the film - at least as I observed, and it was heartfelt in delivery and message. Some of the narrator quirks delivered by Helen Mirren are just perfect and I found myself laughing more than anything else.There are so many nuanced things that make the movie so sweet but the best is probably the nod to the original creator of Barbie and the reason the doll was produced to start.', \"My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for? If you are thinking of watching something this month, choose Sound of Freedom or Mission Impossible.\", \"Honestly I really have no idea why this movie seems to be so popular. Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...\", \"This film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character. However, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler Barbie's heels.The script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their Barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including STEM-based jobs. She helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. Barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.Barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. Playing with Barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.Regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional Barbie doll. Instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. The friendships between the Barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. Rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. There's a monologue by America Ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. I thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.In the spirit of equality, I also had high hopes this film would promote Barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). It didn't go there at all.One aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of Barbie and Ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. It was evident that Barbie did not reciprocate Ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. The movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. Ken, was extremely co-dependent and Barbie just saw him as an accessory. Yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.In terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. Most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. Additionally, the Ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. It came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.Overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.Additionally, Barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. It would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that Barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. Sure she's 'ordinary real-world' Barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. The story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.Overall, I had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book.\", \"Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me.\", \"But damnit, it was GREAT. The opening scene was good, then the first scene in Barbieland worried me. Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for. The link was weird but vibrant and balanced in a way the big screen really lit up.Also, no spoilers, but the Ken bonfires scene made me actually laugh out loud. And I love comedy, but almost never laugh out loud.\", 'The story feels like watching modern animated barbie movies in this past decade. If you lower your expectations, you gonna kinda enjoy it. The first 30 minutes is good, but the last 30 minutes feel rushed.It\\'s Enjoyable movie for Barbie fans out there, the visual look good. It\\'s not a serious movie, the genre is comedy after all. Feel like watching SNL. The casts look having fun in this movie.But when they really want delivering the \"women\\'s have power or something\" message, I can\\'t really follow what they said when have long speech about it. I\\'m a woman, but even for me the way they delivering the message still feel forced. Just long speech can\\'t catch audience attention.Anyway I\\'m still crying in the end of the movie, after all those silly scenes. Because Margot Robbie acting is so good. Showing how beautiful being alive.It\\'s a fun Movie.', \"The fact that this movie did so well proves how bad this summer is for movies. I don't see what the big deal is, it felt like a mixed bag of boredom with some entertainment. There's a few laughs, few and far between that is.If you're interested in seeing this film I can't recommend paying your hard earned money that's required to see it in the theatres. Not to mention if you want popcorn and snacks. I recommend Wait until it's on a streaming service you already have or at your local library where you can get it for free. But like so much nonsense out there, this is not worth It.One side note it was a pleasure to see Rhea Perlman again. She's always delightful.\", \"This movie is many things. One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\", 'This movie was a big hype not only in the internet but also in the local radio and tv. This was a good reason to watch this movie. It was watched in a open place cinema. The audience flooded it more than its limit with a rate of 70/30 of females vs males.Let me be more results oriented.The movie was a rather hilarious with lots of funny scenes starting from the very start. Also think that he main scene in Barbie land was a place with plenty of plastic ware all highly magnified with real actors. She and Ken found a culture shock reaching the real world. Dialogues in the second half were quite deep giving a rather different moral then we cold expect raising the IQ of the movie until the end when barbie took a rather unexpected decision for her future life. Many political projections too definitely a movie for teens than children\\nGenerally the movie was quite bizarre in most of the story. Main actors were quite good\\nRating 6/10 the end was more interesting.', 'I found the movie to be refreshing, but it\\'s far from perfect.Ryan Gosling\\'s performance was the best thing about the movie. His sequences were the most memorable for me, which is something I never expected myself to say. His character, Ken, also happened to be well written.On the other hand, Barbie was a disappointing character. Margot Robbie was good enough. Even though there was nothing special about her performance, she wasn\\'t the problem. It\\'s just her arc was weakly written. The motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable. Her development at the end did not make sense. She wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours, during which she didn\\'t go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end. She didn\\'t even save the day; her owner did. It felt like Barbie was a supporting character in her own movie.Ken stole the show for the most part. Also, the song \"I\\'m just Ken\" should be nominated for the academy\\'s \"Best Original Song\" award. It\\'s just very catchy and the transitions in the song are very creative.The story overall could have been better.', ': I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.', \"The trailers and marketing for the movie were so good that I was really disappointed when the movie took an odd turn after 20-30 minutes into it.There could have been so many better turns than the one they took:Barbie could have inspired the real world to be more Barbie-like (example: the movie Enchanted)Barbie could have spent her time in the real world helping the sad girlBarbie could have spent the whole rest of the movie in the real world figuring out who she wanted to beInstead it became an odd war between men and women, which in the end, ended with just as much inequality as there is in the real world but with women in power and men not even having any homes. I don't get why they went with that. The Barbie movie could have ended with equality.\", 'Margot does the best with what she\\'s given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, l\\'m in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.', \"I knew going into Barbie that I was in for a visual feast. The trailers showcased the wonderful set design, costumes, and performances already. But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not. She'll find new meaning to add in whatever she does.\", \"I am at a complete loss for words but I will try to do my best to summarize how I feel.This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Now admittedly, I only watched 3/4 of it but that's all I could take. I was ready to turn it off after 10 minutes but wanted to give it a shot to see why this is the biggest movie of the year. And I am dumbfounded of why. This movie is not funny. In fact, it's sad and unfunny. This movie should have been one of those direct to video movies.There was a group of four of us and no one laughed. Not one single person and there were two girls in the group. They thought it was really bad too, and I bet a lot of you out there think the same, but maybe are afraid to say so.1/10 - One of the worst movies I have ever 3/4 seen.\", 'Unfortunately, most reviews that I\\'ve read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn\\'t offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn\\'t expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!', \"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.\", \"I really thought this would just be a cute movie, but it actually had a very deep message and I really hope people can take the messages away from this movie because there was a few. I think they did great with the Barbie movie. It was entertaining. The special effects were adorable, but the message was so HUGE in this movie.Watching these light fluffy cute reviews, I know most people missed it.First of all, Barbie was very empowering in her own world where she could be anything she wanted and looking her best while doing it AND the men were not needed, NOT IN CHARGE and all The Ken's cared about was whether or not, they received any attention from their Barbie\\nSound familiar kept wives? Trophy Wives you have no other purpose except to look incredible for your stupid rich husband. That was Ken.The second she went into the real world. She was cat called had her ass slapped, got arrested for defending herself, and was treated with pretty privilege at the police station all while being treated like a blonde bimbo by people in the street. The complete opposite of Barbieland.I hope that people can take away from Barbie and Ken how the roles were reversed when they went from Barbieland to the real world and you could see Barbie becoming very anxious and self-conscious, while Ken became very self-confident, felt amazing he felt empowered immediately for the first time in his life, and you could almost see him go from proud to being a man to toxic masculinity within one scene.The teen angst was a good part too. Barbie was empowering to millions of girls but not to everybody. She has also given millions a very severe complex about body image, pretty privilege and society accepting them only if they look a certain way and Barbieland totally emphasizes that.Even the biggest Barbie was well done up. Dresses well hair done speaks delicately.Everyone there was picture perfect. Dainty and feminine. Even the Supreme Court were beauty pageant champions.This movie is actually deeper than I thought it would be. It was really good I really like Margot Robbie I think she's absolutely adorable as Barbie and I felt bad for her for most of the movie because she went from being a brilliant, beautiful and inspiring idol to some cat called bimbo with pretty privilege in the real world that they wanted to just put in a box.\", '\"If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all\"\\nAnd this was my girlfriend\\'s statement as soon as we left the cinema.I see it as an ok movie, occasionally very entertaining but overall chaotic, a bit cliché and even boring at times.Solid 6/10, i\\'ve seen worse but pales in comparison to The Lego Movie and other \"nostalgic intellectual property movies\" such as Mario Bros, which can contain deep messages without ruining the whole thing as I feel Barbie did.I have to give credit to the numerous exhilarating scenes with the Kens and the CEO, stereotyping done right IMHO.', \"The first half was pretty enjoyable, fun, light, but it took itself too seriously by the second half. No longer allowing the talented cast, especially Gosling, to shine and make us laugh. It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat underutilized. Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me, without the laughs he gave me, it would've definitely been lower than 6/10. I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie. Some is fine, but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end. Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate, it felt forced and out of place.\", \"The film opens strongly with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering compelling performances. Their star power and acting prowess add depth to the movie. However, as the film progresses and Barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world, the thin plot becomes more noticeable. Some viewers might have preferred a subtler approach to delivering the political message, as the film can be seen as overly direct, leading to a polarizing and preachy tone. This approach aligns with the directorial style and screenplay motifs commonly associated with Greta Gerwig.The production design of Barbie Land is visually captivating, offering a feast for the eyes. The music soundtrack, featuring a standout disco track by Dua Lipa, complements the film well. Dua Lipa's cameo as Mermaid Barbie is a highlight.The film incorporates satire and self-aware humor, which adds depth to the story. However, the humor doesn't consistently land, and some moments feel forced. The character Stereotypical Ken provides sporadic moments of humor.In summary, 'Barbie' is a film worth watching at least once. It includes an empowerment monologue delivered by America Ferrera's character, addressing societal expectations placed on women. While there is still some double standard in gender role expectations, it is less prominent in today's society compared to the past.\", \"I saw this movie tonight and it was very entertaining but if your a parent and have young Children THEY WILL GET BORED as this is not a kids movie, it is on a higher intellectual plain than that. You could honestly say this is a movie for feminists, now thats not a bad thing as I saw it with my daughter and have always encouraged her to be whoever she wanted to be and played with Barbie when she was young (she's 23 now) .This movie has it's moments of comedy and is well done especially when in the Barbie world and has been well thought out and written. Cast very well as the two leads carry the movie and i'm sure there will be a sequel. But remember this is not a KIDS movie.\", \"This movie was everything I didn't know I needed. Was great to just escape from the world for 2 hours. Truly one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while. Fun from beginning to end. Margot was amazing and so was Ryan gosling. 100% recommend for everyone especially if you're a father to a daughter I think it has a Good Message Emmet for all, but especially girls to be what they want to be, and how they can truly be anything. The outfits and stages were amazing. It literally looks like you were at a toy store. I will be surprised if they don't win anything for costumes. I definitely will be buying this movie when it comes out.\", \"I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.\", 'First of all: Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie and I also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish. Both the pink dominated Barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinion.Unfortunately there isn\\'t much more to the movie than that. The story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence: Neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women. That\\'s it, that\\'s all.The story revolves around the word \"patriarchy\" with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween, none of which really worked for me. What\\'s left is the empty feeling of lost potential.The main plot element of the first few minutes, the fact that Barbie suddenly isn\\'t perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection (that sounds interesting, right?), is almost completely ignored in favor of what I pointed out above; the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this \"perfect\" Barbieland in the first case. Yes, there\\'s the running gag with Will Ferrell as a CEO and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best. It will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story. If you\\'re lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mind.Then in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical, we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues. How can anyone enjoy this? 4/10 for the style and the acting.', \"When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.\", \"A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.The irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion. One might argue this is not the case since it is mostly Ken's that are depicted this way. But since the Ken's behaviour are supposed to reflect the human female's experiences of men in general, that argument falls flat.In Short, enjoyable film, but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing.\", \"I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great. I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.\", \"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.\", 'I knew this was going to be political going in but I thought its Barbie so I could overlook it. But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it\\'s left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn\\'t like Ken, it\\'s wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it\\'s iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very \"told and not shown\" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn\\'t really like that. The ending was confusing does Barbie want to have a baby?', 'In Greta\\'s \"Barbie,\" the iconic doll takes on real-world problems in this comedy-meets-existential film, transforming from a seemingly superficial figure to a multi-dimensional character. Through physical and emotional challenges, Barbie discovers the true strength that comes from within, while the movie skillfully balances humor with deeper existential questions. As her journey unfolds, Barbie\\'s exploration of empathy and self-discovery resonates profoundly with audiences, reminding them of the significance of creative freedom in cinema. The film\\'s portrayal of Barbie\\'s evolution from a controversial symbol to a beacon of empowerment becomes a captivating exploration of womanhood and the enduring spirit of femininity.', 'The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn\\'t ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. \"Stereotypical\" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha\\'s comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha\\'s mother Gloria (Ugly Betty\\'s America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha\\'s old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha\\'s help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society\\'s conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie\\'s self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken\\'s friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland\\'s previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls \"wanted to be\"; she named \"Barbie\" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie\\'s story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \"Barbara Handler\", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi\\'s Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education\\'s Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls\\' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable \"stereotypical\" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (\"Pink\" by Lizzo, \"Dance the Night\" by Dua Lipa) (the original \"Barbie Girl\" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. Very good!', 'The film does not live up to the marketing. Its about as subtle as a steamroller and deep as a puddle. There must be primary school books with more depth and nuance than this film.The music is good and the plot moves along at pace but its like it was written by an angsty tween. \"Yay feminism\" is about as deep as the message gets and its pretty much the entire purpose and plot of the film. It doesn\\'t offer up anything to think about, just a bubblegum world that is just a carbon copy of the toys.With all the \"Barbenhiemer\" hype and marketing I expected more from the movie, Oppenheimer and Barbie are about as polar opposites of film-making as its possible to get.', \"This is a masterpiece with little to no short-cuts taken on everything that makes a film great - writing, wardrobe, make-up, choreography, set, acting etc. The cast is incredible. Margot Robbie fits the role of Barbie so well. Ryan Gosling (IMO) steals the show as Ken. I found his performance to be the stand-out. I always love seeing Issa Rae anywhere and I think she should be everywhere because she's so talented. I can't say enough about America Ferrera's monologue rant - the writing of that monologue was spectacular but Ferrera's delivery of it was one of my favourite scenes in this movie.I think Greta Gerwig's work here is incredible and I think this movie will be remembered for many years to come.\", \"Dont fall for the 5 star reviews. This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.Good humour but when they don't have anything to say they sing songs. Basically a musical movie, reminds me of High School Musical.Margot Robbie is amzing but Ryan Gosling steals the show not with his looks but his acting. He's the one who was gripping the movie. You will get to know about lot of Barbie you didnt know about.There will be moments where you'll be like whats going on? Why am i here ? Why didn't i book the tickets for oppenheimer early but this too shall pass.\", \"I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done.\", 'The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could\\'ve been great.For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as \"Stereotypical Barbie\" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It\\'s a \"lecturing feminist\" and \"bring down the patriarchy\" kind of movie. I wasn\\'t expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.In general, if you\\'re looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.', \"Let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isn't from the MCU or a sequel doing so well at the box office. There is still originality out there. This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end. I can definitely see this being a movie people see over and over.Side note: Greta Gerwig must be a fan of Sex Education - three actors end up here.\", 'I think i laughed maybe twice. Michael cera was probably the best thing in the movie and he wasnt that funny here. Nothing made sense, there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream, just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch. I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of \"manly\". Overall it was just super weird and not that funny.', \"I went to this movie just to see the eye candy of beautiful people and fanciful sets because, come on, who is more perfectly beautiful to portray Barbie than Margot Robbie? And who's more attractive to be Ken other than Ryan Gosling?This movie was too long, too wordy and too preachy to be for actual children. Which is odd since it's about the most iconic doll of all time.The creation of the Barbie world was awesome: sets and props. But the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didn't impress, and neither did the resolution of the story. How about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other? Some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble. Also, they didn't have to pointedly throw in that Barbie was drinking cow milk- cow on the label in all caps. Are the writers anti vegan? At least they mentioned in the film to the audience that Ken was wearing faux fur, but it was like a condescending little note because I guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows. Anyways, the best parts of this movie were: Ryan Gosling all the way (gorgeous, funny, singing and dancing,) the conflict between the two alpha Kens and introducing me to Simu Liu and Issa Rae. Despite its flaws, I'm glad I followed the hype and saw this movie. But I doubt I could sit through it again, it's just too silly and canned preachy.\", \"Barbie is the latest toy turned movie adapation and stars Margot Robbie(Birds of Prey),Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Alexandra Ship(A Dogs Way Home),Dua Lipa,Will Ferrell(Elf),America Ferrara(Ugly Betty)and Helen Mirren(Shazam Fury Of The Gods) as the narrator.The story follows Barbie(Robbie) who notices strange things happening to her. She thinks about death,her feet are flat and she shows emotions. So she decides to go to weird Barbie (Kate McKennon) for advice and travels to the real world to find her owner Gloria(Ferrara) and her daughter Sasha to find out why she is malfunctioning. But will Barbie choose the real world or the plastic land of Barbie Land?.Overall I actually liked this film .Yes it's very silly and stupid but it was entertaining. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken who is obsessed with horses and prospecy and the other guys as Ken including new Dr Who Ncuti and Secret Invasion star Kingston Ben Adir and Michael Cena as Allan. I guess if I had to change anything it would be for Barbie to stay in the human world more and actually have them as actual Barbie dolls first like Life Size or even Enchanted animated.If you loved Elf(since Will Ferrell stars in both films and the setting mirrors it too) and The Lego Movie along with adding sexual innuendo and woman's rights along with men's rights then you'll enjoy it. Would I recommend 6 year olds to see it no,unless they have a parent.6/10.\", \"The movie has a very clever intro, a charming set-up filled with sight gags, and some hilarious lines (especially those spoken by the narrator - Helen Mirren).However, it's essentially about a town of marginalized and emasculated men (the Kens) and when they discover they are only disaffected props, they create a toxic patriarchy (although we never see how they do it). The Barbies then manipulate the Kens, using feminine wiles and playing dumb, to coerce the Kens into a war with each other to distract them back into submission.Adding to a magnum of plot holes, and an ending that takes WAY too long, is a weird 'Pinocchio' twist when Barbie only becomes satisfied with her existence when she gets a vagina.This film panders to a pseudo-feminist audience. If you want to see a film where feminism is funny and wins in the end, see Legally Blonde.\", \"This movie is charming and many people I know who also watched this absolutely loved it and recommended it to me. The movie was hilarious and we all had a laugh. Everybody enjoyed this and actually had fun. At the end of the movie I was left with wanting more. This movie is at least in the top 5 as it was something I didn't expect to enjoy. I thought at first that it would just another mediocre movie but I was so wrong. Somehow everything about this movie put together worked so well. Ryan Gosling as Ken and Margot Robbie as Barbie both casts did a fantastic job. I would absolutely rewatch this as it was better than I expected. I highly recommend this. This Barbie movie got everybody wearing pink and it just did everything right. Honestly hats off to all casts & crew. I LOVED THIS!!!\", 'The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn\\'t THAT good. The story wasn\\'t as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn\\'t say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.Ps. I find it weird that this is considered such a \"woke\" movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls ONCE. Like cmon I had a Barbie too!', 'Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)*The list of gorlz is ever growing and may only be influenced by my opinion.', \"This movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting. The script is quite clever and fun, and get this: there is not one word of profanity. (This just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be well-written and need not have dozens of f-bombs.) I give it even more bonus points for good actors who don't mumble. I was beginning to think that today's actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box. How refreshing to hear every word! Though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment, this is not a movie just for women. My husband enjoyed it very much. Young children won't get most of it, but they might enjoy the visuals. Highly recommended.\", \"I saw Barbie, starring Margot Robbie-Babylon, the Suicide Squad movies; Ryan Gosling-Blade Runner 2049, La La Land; America Ferrera-Superstore_tv, Ugly Betty_tv; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Ghostbusters_2016 and Will Ferrell-Holmes & Watson, the Daddy's Home movies.This is a weird, funny and thought provoking movie about a doll that was created in 1959 by Ruth Handler. Before the movie starts, there are several music videos with singers and stars from the film. The movie then goes straight to Barbie Land, where everything is pink-Barbie's favorite color-and everyone sings and dances a lot. Margot is the main Barbie-there are lots of them, of course, as well as Kens-and Ryan is the main Ken. Everything is going along like usual for Margo until she starts having visions of death and despair. The rest of the Barbies tell her to consult with Kate-the weird Barbie-and Kate tells her that she must go to the real world and find out the source of her problems. Ryan goes with her and they both discover that in the real world, it's not run by Barbies but instead by men. Will plays the CEO of Mattel and America is his secretary. There are messages about feminism and the role of the Barbie doll in shaping little girls' minds-both good and bad-and there are several cameos of actors you may recognize, as Ken and Barbie.It's rated PG-13 for some language and some sexual innuendo-mostly just jokes-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.Although I would probably not buy it on DVD, it is entertaining and would be a good one to stream.\", \"Honestly, not too sure what my partner and I were expecting, but we figured it would be a fun, empowering, and sweet movie.Instead, we got a preachy, confused, mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way.Unfortunately, I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience. The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there.\", \"I went and watched Barbie with my younger brother, and we both had lots of fun throughout the entire movie, even durkng the more emotional parts. The outfits, music, sets, characters, and everything are super colorful and interesting.It does cover some topics such as the patriarchy, but in silly and goofy way, such as Ken thinking the patriarchy had to do with horses. I didn't find the movie all that political, since they did cover those topics in a way that people would still be having fun while the movie was talking about them. The acting was amazing, so was the choreography during the songs (which were also really fun), while also having a nice message at the end.It's fun for everyone (my 10-year-old brother who has no interest in dolls says he'd give it a 9.5/10), and I definetly reccomend you go watch it!!\", \"As I watched Barbie the Movie, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The vibrant pink color that permeated the film brought back memories of my childhood, when everything seemed so vibrant and full of life.What struck me most about the movie was that it wasn't a typical superhero genre movie, which is so common in today's movie industry. Instead, it was a live-action non-comic book movie that was a breath of fresh air.The movie sets were stunning, with wild and imaginative backgrounds that were so fun to see on a beach. The foreground was equally as enjoyable, with standees that added a touch of whimsy to the film.As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but feel like a kid again. The childhood thoughts and memories that flooded my mind made me feel like I was back in time, experiencing the joy and wonder of childhood all over again.Overall, Barbie the Movie was a pleasure to watch. The imagination and creativity that went into the scene and set construction were seamlessly free-flowing throughout the film. The shocking colors and playful designs were a delight to see and made for an unforgettable movie experience.......\", 'Oppression is a state of mind, even when objectively you are oppressed.The biggest problem with this movie is that it leans HARD into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by MEN (as if we\\'re some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugated-talk about intellectually lazy) AND the only acceptable man is an Allen (wimpy effeminate man). This movie could\\'ve provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes, or how men and women complement each other, but NO. Instead in the final act, it chooses sides. And the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side, the \"equity\" side. The side of \"well, do unto others as you FEEL (in your hyper-oppressed feeling state) they\\'ve done unto you.\" You feel like the Kens have done you wrong, so you oppress them in return. Never mind the Barbies oppressed the Kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie, and the entirety of the first act. But no, the Kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay. Equity demands retribution, so all men, excuse me, Kens, must pay.While I laughed and enjoyed the first two acts, in the end I felt thoroughly disappointed, angry, nauseated. If they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it would\\'ve been a 10/10, but they couldn\\'t resist making it propaganda. I guess the joke\\'s on me for taking our girls to it.Also, there\\'s a monologue in the third act which could\\'ve been BRILLIANT, if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how ALL HUMANS feel (not just women, men too). Every man I\\'ve ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society, from women, from other men. It\\'s not just a woman thing.Oh and then the last 5-10 minutes or so were... almost like a different movie. It just didn\\'t line up with who Barbie was, and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occur.In the end, THIS KEN (me) cannot recommend this film to other Kens. Unless you\\'re the kind of liberal / progressive man who believes the whole \"women are oppressed\" narrative. Then you\\'ll probably love it. Every other guy though? Or the women who love them? I\\'d recommend taking a pass on this one. Or watch the first 75% and then leave.Bottom line this is every bit as \"toxic\" as some forms of masculinity. This is just \"toxic feminism.\" And I say that as a feminist.', \"I identify as both Barbie and Ken... This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and it even made me cry. This film is such a raw, yet humorous look at how hard life is, as well as gender and everything that falls under that... From how the patriarchy hurts both men and women, how hard it is to live and not be exceptional, and the ideas at play in life. I loved the costume and set design, it feels like everyone in this film really cared about the franchise of Barbie. I feel like all of imagination at play is gorgeous. The soundtrack is also an amazing piece here. I've seen this film twice, and it has truly affected my life... Incredible.\", \"Barbie the movie was much better and with more character, story quality and depth than I expected. I went into the movie to see what the fuss was about and for a bit of something fun to do and left feeling happy the rest of the day, thinking about its story a lot, the interesting execution and styling. I also played the soundtrack which has some great songs.To me movie turned out to not be preachy or about being feminist. I think the people who think so are misinterpreting that. At its heart, and this movie does have heart, it ties to Mattel's slogan and concept for Barbie products - You Can Be Anything. It's about finding out who you are and feeling empowered to be yourself, whatever that may be.It's a unique style of film and one I thoroughly found myself enjoying. I find myself wanting to see it again already.If you're in doubt whether to go and see this movie go, if you are like me and some other reviewers I've seen you may come away feeling glad you did.\", \"I wasn't dying to see this, but I felt like I had to participate in the Barbenheimer phenomenon, and the trailer looked good, so I went. I went in with reasonably high expectations because the reviews were high and it has a good cast and crew behind it. I was slightly disappointed.I enjoy Robbie's acting, and I also like Will Ferrell (who doesn't), it's got some good chuckles, the screenplay is solid. The soundtrack is also pretty good.Now, what's bad about it? Well, I felt like a film like this would be a tad more realistic then it was. This felt like an animated film inside a live action film. I feel like there were some parts that were unnecessary.Well, it was pretty good. If you want a comedy, you'd like this one.NOTE: Although I enjoyed both, I think Oppenheimer reigns superior to Barbie.\", 'I\\'m not a Barbie fan. The only time I loved Barbie was when she was in the Toy Story movies. But that changed after I saw the Barbie movie. This movie is not only Greta Gerwig\\'s best film but also the year\\'s greatest movie so far!!!!! Margot Robbie (my favorite actress of all time) is beautiful and portrays Barbie with pure perfection!!! And then there\\'s Ken (played by Ryan Gosling in a career-best performance)!!! Robbie and Gosling shine and are easily the years best duo.The story starts with Barbie doing her usual routine in Barbieland, a land filled with multiple Barbies, each with a different occupation. The Ken\\'s also visit playing the roles a woman would play. Barbie starts experiencing real emotional symptoms like thinking about death, crying and flat feet. She learns from Weird Barbie that the Real World will have the answers to her questions. Barbie than travels with Ken to the real world and find out many things : Barbie is a doll played by a grown woman named Gloria (America Ferrera in her best movie performance), Mattel wants to put Barbie back in the box and Ken learns about America\\'s patriarchy and men rule the world. All of these problems combine into a hilarious comedy that provides great messages about woman empowerment and being who you want to be.The production design of Barbieland and costumes of all the Barbies and Kens are Oscar-worthy. The soundtrack is pretty solid with two great songs: Ryan Gosling\\'s 80s ballad called I\\'m Just Ken and Billie Ellish\\'s emotional song at the end of the movie, \"What was I made for?\".The direction of Greta Gerwig is finally put to great use in Barbie as she\\'s goes to make the best comedy in years and the script she wrote with her partner Noah Baumbach is the perfect mixture of stupid comedy, great-comedy drama and emotional drama.Gosling gives his best and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination as his role of Ken is up there with the comedy greats of Meliss Mccarthy in Bridesmaids and Robert Downey Jr. In Tropic Thunder.The real scene stealer is Margot Robbie. Robbie has been in multiple box office failures but Barbie changed that. She\\'s been nominated twice for the Oscar for her incredible performances in I, Tonya and Bombshell. My favorite actress is about to be nominated for Best Actress and Best Picture for Barbie!!!! Margot Robbie is astonishing and a tour de force in Barbie, which is the best performance of her whole career!!! Go Margot Robbie!!!!!This movie is definitely worth watching!!!!!! I want to watch it again!!!!!!', \"Barbie is the latest toy being turned into a live action movie and stars Margot Robbie(Suicide Squad), Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Michael Cena(Scott Pilgram Vs The World),Alexandra Shipp(A Dogs Way Home),America Ferrara (Ugly Betty)and Will Ferrell(Elf). Directed by Greta Gerwig the film follows Barbie(Robbie) a sophisticated young doll who notices that she is slowly turning human so she goes to the real world to find her previous owner and to meet the CEO boss (Ferrell) to find out why she is malfunctioning.Will she go back to BarbieLand or stay in the real world. Overall I was very surprised by this film. The cinematography was very good if not artificial,the story reminded me of Elf meets The Lego Movie. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken. Also stars Rhea Pherlman from Matilda,Helen Mirren as the narrator who throws fourth wall jokes,singer Dua Lipa as a mermaid and John Cena as a merman. Its a very silly yet stupid film but it's definetly a good movie.\", \"Having seen this movie twice now, I've laughed, I've cried and I enjoyed every minute of this movie! When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was thinking there is no way this movie will be any good! Well I am happy to say that I am wrong because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Margot Robbie was great as Barbie while Ryan Gosling was great as Ken! It also stars America Ferreira, Will Farrell and other A-List actors! It definitely has a great story line to it and the soundtrack was also amazing! For those who are skeptical about the movie, DON'T BE! I highly recommend it.\", \"Don't know where to begin. This movie is a bland salad. Can't believe I actually see people throwing around the word masterpiece to describe this complete and utter trash of a movie. Jaws, schindlers list, inception, kill bill. Those are masterpiece. This movie is master poop. If u are having trouble falling asleep then watch the first half of the movie. It's a snoozer. Script is clumsy. This movie is what is wrong with cinema and television as of late. Don't know who they are making movies for. This is definitely not for the general public. This isn't a movie anyone wanted to see. The masters like Christopher Nolan could fart a better movie than this.\", \"Honestly it's Ryan Gosling that made this movie for me and no not just the holy cow hot body! He's got such a great sense of humour so funny, him and Simu Liu just bounced off each other so well. It's a cute little fun movie if you just want a good laugh. Im still trying to understand Will Ferrells character though, it was very lame and I know he's supposed to be the antagonist but it really did not work for me.The sets and the costumes were fantastic exactly how I imagined my Barbie used to live-😁. I think they could have dug a little deeper and done multi-era costumes, regardless it was just a lot of fun to watch!\", \"Greta Gerwig's live-action Barbie is a surprisingly entertaining and funny film that will appeal to both kids and adults.The film is full of jokes and laugh-out-loud moments, and Ryan Gosling is a scene-stealer as Ken. He has eight abs, of course, but he also gives a surprisingly good performance. The film has a positive message about self-acceptance. Barbie learns that she doesn't have to be perfect to be loved and accepted.The film does have some flaws. The plot is a bit predictable, and the film could have been a bit shorter. However, the flaws are minor, and Barbie is ultimately a lot of fun. It's a great film for kids and adults alike, and it's sure to be a hit with fans of the iconic doll.\", \"Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.\", \"I saw the trailer and knew it would be a pretty fun movie to watch. It was so over the top with just everything (colours, world of women, world of men, horses and lectures) that in the end, all what matters was I laughed tears watching it. And so did everybody in the cinema I went to. The beach fight, Ken's obsession with horses and Will Ferrell on rollerblades.. it can't get better than that. The only issue for me was the end, when Barbie decides to go to the real world. That scene was a bit long.If you like sarcasm, satire and Will Ferrell, go and watch! You will have a colourfull two hours.\", 'I loved the music , and the fun start.A bit of cheeky humor , and dance choreography.The story was quite confusing, it felt like being glued with superglue and not consistent from the beginning to the end . The ending was quite weird . And switching between the two worlds of the story did not make much sense . The character from the Mattel management did not add any value to the story . If they were edited out , I think no one would even notice a difference .The main male character has done a good job , especially in his macho phase .The female main character was lovely . Absolutely gorgeous and well played .', 'Barbie was a very funny and cute movie, however, the movie had more fluff than substance. The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing \"lego movie\" and \"barbie goes to the real world\" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera\\'s character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn\\'t come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive. Also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like I was watching a super bowl half time commercial.', 'The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie\\'s world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn\\'t until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.The Barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls, and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience (even men) to think about. But if you are a male viewer, and if all you took from this movie is that \"it hates men\", then you completely missed the point. The movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques Barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be. It pokes fun at it, while never completely turning against Barbie as a product. This is a Barbie movie after all. That this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film, is a good thing, including criticizing gender stereotypes. But the execution leaves more to be desired.There is plenty to critique about the Barbie movie that is valid. The Barbie movie tries to do a lot of things, and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess. The movie could have benefited from a bit more focus. Instead, it is all over the place.Just the plot of Barbie and Ken being confronted with the real world, probably would have been enough for a whole movie. But to the movie\\'s credit, it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a Barbie movie. I would argue, too much.There\\'s the plot of Mattel trying to capture Barbie, with the awkwardness of a Mattel product (what this movie is) critiquing Mattel. It never feels entirely earnest.Then there\\'s the plot of Barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her. This plot works the best, but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going on.Then there\\'s the side plot of Barbie meeting her creator, which at first feels like a random easter egg, but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie, without really fitting in with all the other plots. The Barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not. At first it seems as if Barbie-land is the place that is magical and unrealistic, which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor. Once Barbie and Ken visit the real world, the contrast leads to more humor. But then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world, and things become very messy. Such as Mattel having a mysterious floor where Barbie\\'s deceased creator is still alive. This is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line, but that doesn\\'t quite explain it either. The movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building. It was a side plot we didn\\'t need in the first place.Then there is the plot of Ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes, and then bringing all that back to Barbie-land. This plot feels a bit disjointed. It ends up dragging the third act back to Barbie-land, when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act. Everything with Barbie trying to make the other Barbies remember who they are, and revisiting ugly Barbie, should have been cut. It feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going on.All in all, it is a bit of a mess storywise. This script could have used a bit more editing. Also, it ends on a joke about Barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist, which is a bit of low hanging fruit. When you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls, this is probably not the line should end on. Suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more sense.As a comedy movie, you can\\'t aim for a high bar story wise, when your movie\\'s comedy is aiming for the lowest bar. It doesn\\'t seem to work.', \"Fantastic movie! The writing and storyline is so much deeper than I could have imagined for a Barbie movie. I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice opening week and plan to buy it once it hits streaming. I think women and girls of all ages will love it. I know plenty of guys who like it as well. It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal. I loved her version of Little Women and this is every bit as good. Barbie is a must see. Don't wait, go see it now!\", \"The movie was weirdly quick at the beginning and weirdly long at the end. The beginning of the film felt like a glorified way to show off Margot Robbie's feet. The movie it self was quite meta at times and even made me laugh but I felt like it had too much hype. Also was the movie about sexism or getting older and was Will Ferril the villain or was Ken. There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different. I Manley started re-enjoying the movie was when the kens had their battle. Sorry if I have wasted your time but that's my opinion.\", \"Great visuals but the 'plot' felt like a bunch of stale ideas that the writers were desperate to include but hadn't really thought through. A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though! It it got me excited to see the film and buy a ticket, but the 'bait and switch' nature of the campaign left me confused and disappointed.\", \"Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film. The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.Ryan Gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in. Several of the cameos were also great.Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'. Mostly watched it as the first part of the Barbenheimer meme, so it was worth it for that reason at least.7/10.\", \"There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.\", 'Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023MILD spoilers ahead.\"Barbie,\" directed by Greta Gerwig, is one of the most bizarre films in recent memory. A popular toy tailored at young girls gets a chance at being one of the year\\'s best films. Its whimsical, funny marketing alongside its promising cast would suggest such. Unfortunately, the film botches that opportunity, but still has some fun moments. Even though it is not as funny as many other comedies, the film manages to stay in one\\'s head after leaving the theater.From its colorful presentation to its glowing characters, Barbie\\'s opening proposes that the movie will be roaringly entertaining. The music is great, the narration pokes fun at the Barbie brand, and the events are overly silly. Margot Robbie does a superb job at capturing the zany but stiff expressions one would expect from Barbie. Accompanying her is the equally funny Ken, who is played by Ryan Gosling. The two are fun to watch and their adventure appears to be one enjoyable time!Despite the promising opening, the film, like cheap plastic, breaks apart very quickly. Once Barbie and Ken go to the real world, the jokes are lazy and subplots are underexplored. The picture\\'s demographic is also confusing. What looked like a kids\\' film with humor adults can enjoy ends up giving discomforting questions parents have to discuss with their children. (For example, what a penis or a vagina means.) The sporadic sexual humor lacks a proper set up which makes for a lackluster punchline, resulting in cringey moments that, at the moment, raise questions for who this film is tailored for.\"Barbie\" also suffers from being a mostly directionless film, as its plot is unfocused but its message is very prominent. It sets up around three plotlines that were likely pitched individually and crams them all into one story with none of these concepts receiving their proper conclusions. It makes for a frustrating ending. The moral is also confusing and seems to spark more of a negative message than a positive one. Instead of the conflicts being resolved where everyone lives in harmony, it is a tug-o-war on which sex has the right to be selfish. It may make some viewers, especially impressionable children, think lower of both sexes or believe their gender is superior or inferior to the other. It may also cause some unnecessary dispute on the internet.How characters grow is another misstep from Gerwig. Many characters do not develop gradually, but abruptly. Barbie, Ken, and two other leading characters are almost unrecognizable to their third-act counterparts. It is difficult to root for any of them as they all aim to achieve their selfish desires instead of coming up with a plan where everyone is happy. If the characters were likable and the overall message was less overboard, it could have matched the quality its marketing advised.Even if it is a bit of a disappointment, there were some laugh-out-loud moments. Fourth-wall breaking jokes were well placed and parodies of other films or events were a joy. The production and music almost make up for the aimless story as it stays true to the brand but also makes the newer ideas feel fresh and organic. The choreography in some sequences is exceptional and, like its presentation, reinstates how fun Barbie and friends can be when it treats itself as a lighthearted comedy. It really could have been great if it were to stay in one direction.Barbie - 65/100\\nBarbie is a colorful, occasionally brilliant, but misguided comedy.', 'I saw this movie a month ago and I\\'ve had a hard time gathering my thoughts for a review. I think that I need to give it another watch. That being said, my reaction from my first viewing is mixed.On one side, there are so many positives about this film. The casting is spot-on, with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling perfectly fitting their characters. The visuals in Barbie World are vibrant and exciting. The humor is excellent and made me genuinely laugh out loud. Not to mention the brilliance of Allan.On the other side, the film has an agenda and they push it hard. The message of female empowerment is strong, but at times it crossed over into preachy territory. My theater hardly laughed and the entire row in front of me walked out about 3/4 through. While I loved the moments in Barbie World, I did not enjoy the scenes in the real world or anything with Will Ferrell.At its core, this movie is a powerful reminder of what life is like for a woman (i.e., America Ferrera\\'s monologue) and a call to action for me. Unfortunately, the in-your-face approach might alienate some rather than inspire.Best Character: Ken (Though Allan was brilliant)\\nBest Quote: \"To be honest, when I found out the patriarchy wasn\\'t just about horses, I lost interest.\" - Ken\\nBest Scene: The Intro to Barbie World\\nBest Song: \"I\\'m Just Ken\"', 'I hope you won\\'t let the title of the film fool you; this is not some family movie for little girls. It is an all around auteuristic film by the ever great Greta Gerwig, and an instant classic cult film.It provides some excellent comedy, and at the same time some very clever contemporary commentary on feminism and patriarchy from both sides, in Gerwig and Baumbach\\'s usual styles. Very well-written overall.The cinematography is very uqique, one might say characteristic from Gerwig, but it has its own unique weird, twisted style to it. And I love it.Overall, a very fun film that is certainly deserving of all the praise and hype it has gotten.Like last year\\'s \"Everything and Everywhere all att once\", this is truly a genre-bending experience that I very much hope make it to the Oscars. It is both an incredibly fun and important film!', \"This movie, about Barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence, is a good fantasy movie!I liked the concept, and it reminded me of The Toy Story Quadrilogy (1995-2019). The dolls were living dolls, but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours. The sense of humor were present, and I noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways. Its satire was well used, and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime. The attention to details was fantastic because of the script, the action, the minor details, like eating and drinking, and last, but not least: the sets and the effects - every visual element, basically. The characters' behaviors were like they were controlled by kids, but we didn't see the kids' hands or like that. They acted like they were played with, and that was well executed, I think.I think the story was alright. The outer story in the first and third act was good. The beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of Barbie and how Barbie has affected people before, but also how Barbie should affect us in the right way today. It's all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities, but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others' shoes, because that's how to live as a realistic, self-controlled being. The second act is a big part of a movie, and I got mixed feelings about that act in this movie. It had its meanings, but I think much of what happened, especially in Los Angeles, was sometimes messy and unnecessary. It was much small-talk, and I sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time. Anyway, it didn't ruin the overall experience.In conclusion, this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story. The attention to detail, from the script to the visual elements, enhances the overall experience. The movie's satirical approach appeals to both children and adults, making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences. While the outer story is well-crafted, the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing. Nevertheless, the movie's exploration of Barbie's impact on people's lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable. Despite minor flaws, the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others.\", \"I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.\", 'I guess my starting point was not a huge fan of anything Barbie, but to be honest I went in moderately openminded. The film was dull at times and at others quite subversive!Some great humour some odd moments, felt a little stilted but that was clearly the intent of the film makers.I sat through it feeling at the end mildly perplexed and unsure if I enjoyed it or not.I felt it was at times quite clever but still a bit confusing much of the time.As a 67 year old I may not be the best judge nor did the chatting 7-8 year old two seats away from me add much to the experience.Go see and make your mind up, overall I much preferred Oppenheimer.', \"It's nice to have a movie that's fun and interesting dialogue. I knew the style of the movie by the scenes I'd seen leaked online I think that in itself is not everyone's style but boy it's unique and very barbieland. A lot of thought went into this and it's not just for women it's for anybody. We all need an Allan in our life. I could've used more boardroom ceo scenes with will farrel and his men tho. It's lovely to see the perspective of both men and women and at the end of the day what I got from this movie is about how we're each wanting to find our happiness and who we are outside of someone else.\", \"I saw this movie right now and mostly enjoyed it. The good parts are really enjoyable, but sometimes I was just bored. I really don't know how they did it, but near the end of the movie some scenes were the peak of cinema and some were just uninteresting.They aren't subtle with the politics, the political stuff is very preachy, but my biggest complain about the political stuff is that the movie is not entertaining when they bring it up.I expected a funny quirky movie, but I got to learn about political stuff, which wasn't that good. However, the movie is good when they don't talk about it.\", \"As someone who played with the dolls growin up,the in-jokes and references to some rare Barbie variations and playsets are funny. The political message gives Barbie a new dimension I never thought would go to. I felt a hidden anti-war message in it actually which is deep for a toy I never thought would be taken that serious. Makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchise's history,but on rewatch I'll fast forward to the cheesy funny parts. Would I watch it again? Probably!!!!!!!! Especially after eating a pot cookie,bet this movie would look crazier! After watching I feel I'm on a Barbie kick and searching for the toys.\", \"The title of the review practically sums it all up. With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.However, the opening scene is great (if you know the reference, of course), and there are some funny moments. But they seem to go against the general idea rather than to support it.\", 'This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it\\'s not even a good movie. It\\'s a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can\\'t stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman\\'s movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn\\'t seem to have much substance after the \"I am woman\" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta => This is not your ticket to the Oscars.', 'Wow. I saw this movie on July 23rd and I\\'ve been thinking about it ever since. Right off the bat, the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design. The backdrops, the houses, all of the set decoration in Barbieland is PERFECTION. All of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative. I would love to believe that Barbie can help usher in a new era, where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage, without so much CGI. Set Dec is 10/10Next, I have to talk about Greta Gerwig\\'s clear love of cinema. From the opening sequence that starts with a perfect 2001: A Space Odyssey parody which they absolutely nailed, to a hilarious Matrix reference, and then the overarching clear love of old Hollywood and especially those old school classic musicals. The dance and musical numbers here are just an absolute BLAST!Then there is the acting. It almost feels wrong to say it, but there\\'s no denying that Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in. His comedic timing is a triumph and the fact that we haven\\'t gotten to experience more of this in his film history is a travesty. Margot Robbie is absolute perfection, the most obvious casting for Barbie ever in the history of the world, but don\\'t let that fool you. Her balance between comedy and the emotional scenes are unmatched by anyone else here. She really is one of the best actor of this generation. The rest of the cast also absolutely kills it. America Ferrera Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Will Farrell, etc etc etc, everyone holds their own in this incredible ensemble performance. Acting is 10/10THE MUSIC!!!! It is so iconic and obvious and perfect that we get a full original Barbie album for this film. I\\'m not always a hard pop music kind of person, but it went so perfectly with this film, that I had to order myself a vinyl copy. But best of all, Ryan Gosling\\'s performance in \"I\\'m Just Ken.\" The dance sequence in this one is so freaking fun and good and hilarious. I can only pray that it is nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars so that we can be blessed with a live performance of this gem, can you imagine it?!? Music is 10/10And finally, the script. See how I managed to make it this far in the review without even bringing up what all of those insecure baby men on the internet seem to only be able to focus their tiny brains on? This script is hilarious, SO smart and witty, and deeply poignant and emotional. It hits home so hard on so many points while still being able to poke fun at this doll that has captivated the imagination of children for the last 64 years. I love that even though Barbie has caught some heat in the last decade or so for destroying the body image of women everywhere(I personally did not find that to be the case for me, I was perfectly happy to compare myself to all of the other fellow 10 year old girls in my age group to do that for me) we are able to also look at how the ambitions of this doll, all of her careers, the fact that there was an Astronaut Barbie before there was a woman working at NASA, etc. Then of course the dreaded wish to take down the patriarchy!! If anything in this movie seemed false or offended you, I don\\'t even know what to tell you. This felt like a very real and true example of what its like to walk through this world as a woman. So many women have shared America Ferrera\\'s monologue, and the entire set of scenes after that were some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie. And I say that as a big Matchbox Twenty fan!All in all, this movie for me is a masterpiece, it\\'s stunning, hilarious, emotional and the most fun I may ever have had in a movie theatre. Cannot recommend strongly enough! Easily my favourite movie of 2023, can\\'t imagine how anything else could come close.', \"This movie was supposed to be fun light hearted watch but turns into an obnoxious headache filled with political message on and on and on.The only Relief is honestly Ryan Gosling's Ken who made me crack up multiple times, and he lives as Ken to be honest; there is no Ryan Gosling anymore it's just Ken and he was the protagonist for me.They really show men as cowardly, stupid, needy, power hungry and so on and on. When they showed the real world they could have shown the good and bads parts of it but only the so called patriarchy was shown; like come on. As if it's not already clear for us as audience that all men are horrible and mistreats women we are treated with many monologues of feminism. You would at least think they would go for true equal rights(the thing which actual feminists used to fight for) at the very end but Nooo! The men get satisfied with just 1 seat in that institution instead of it being half and half.\", \"No way on earth this was possible but that's the thing it was possible that the actual barbie movie was so inspiring that I just had to make it the movie of my month despite all odds there's like no way I'm hell that it would surprise any one all the hype worth it all the praise worth it and behold all the stars worth it everything barbie is just golden sorry platinum just to be precised in my opinion, it's like am the only one who feels this way but thinking about how awesome all the connections sums up it's just so magical from the story to the history infact just see this movie. Am a feminist so that's all thee more reason.\", \"So i've just got back from theaters and all i got to say is wow, that was such a fun, funny, charming movie and the Barbie world was just so colorful ! ( which we knew from the trailers )Now before you say\\nanything... no, this movie doesn't hate men, if anything it understands men's struggles just as much as women's, i was scared that the movie whould demonizes(?) Ken too much but he was really funny and you could see where he was coming from, with him always being in Barbie's shadows and all thatSpeaking of Barbie, Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie, she was so perfect that now i have difficulties imagining anyone else as the role of a life action Barbie, and look, i'm not saying this is the best movie of the year but for now... it's the one i liked the most.\", \"This is not a movie to take your 10 year old girl to. On the surface it looks flashy and appealing, but if you listen to the messages you start to realise that it is preaching. And in the least subtle way you could think of.There are a few funny moments, but not enough for it to be considered to be a comedy. And as far as the depth of the 'message' is concerned, all I can say to the writers and director is: do not give up your day job.There is nothing wrong with delivering an important message, however, to be effective it must be done with persuasion and not a sledgehammer. This movie does not understand that.\", \"The beauty in the movie isn't merely skin deep. The story woven throughout Barbie is a true testament to the power of belief in oneself and the importance of friendship and teamwork. Barbie's determination and courage in the face of challenges inspire viewers to embrace their own strengths and strive for greatness. The characters in Barbie are wonderfully developed, each with their own unique personalities that add depth and charm to the narrative. Barbie herself, with her resilience and strong sense of justice, is a shining example of a positive role model.Her friends are equally engaging, showcasing the power of unity and support.Beyond the captivating story, Barbie also crafts an empowering message about inner beauty and acceptance. It teaches viewers that true beauty lies within, emphasizing the importance of self-acceptance and celebrating our individuality.\", \"Barbie made a strong start really. Loved the characters, loved the production design and love love the acting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling but then along the way something happened and the characters dev becomes confusing.Certain characters portraying Mattel exec were added in but in the end they don't really represent anything because their characters doesn't evolve.. and for me it feels to forced to put Mattel in there as a character because of course the would like to look like they are neutral or even a solution, to which we thought, was a problem. However since in the end they practically does not do anything then you are left with the question, do we really need to see the Mattel executives in here?It certainly feel like the script has been rewritten a few times thus the message becomes quite complicated, convoluted and confusing for general folks like me. Is it really satire or is it not? Why are the kens treated like secondclass citizens at the end and why the barbies.\", \"The brand sold it, along with the hype, the actual movie was pretty terrible, despite the big names and famous faces.The mum gave a very long rant about her problems and simultaneously making the dad look unimportant and silly.So apparently Barbie Land being 100% Barbie governed is fine but the opposite in the real world it is not ok....At the end it even joked how the Kens in Barbie Land may one day have the same power as Barbies.. but that's so hypocritical.If you look past all of this stuff then the movie is still pretty dull and not funny either.Overall just disappointing on so many levels.\", \"Who'd have thought that you could make a film about the Barbie doll. Well Greta Gerwig obviously did and what a rip-snorting entertaining piece of colourful fun it is. And on so many different levels too: socio-political commentary, gender roles, off-the-wall mayhem to mention three. There are homages to classic films from the very start that had me rolling with laughter, and it never let up.In some ways I was reminded of Yellow Submarine seasoned with a strong dose of Legally Blonde.If there was anything that dragged it was the ending. So many excellent films barrel along with one plot twist or other surprise after another (Barbie certainly does) and then there's the question of how to tie up the loose ends and provide a believable ending, and in context too. Barbie just about manages it, if a bit hokey. But then there's the final scene. It's a cracker!\", \"This movie made me laugh, and cry. It was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls, while still poking fun at it all. It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect. It was beautiful and I'd watch again.\", \"Everything is perfect in Barbieland. Every day is identikit pink perfection for all the Barbies, and also for the Kens as long as they're getting attention. Then stereotypical Barbie starts getting dark thoughts, which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the Real World. So, accompanied by Ken, Barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human, only to find that the Real World is not at all like Barbieland. And Ken discovers patriarchy. And horses.As a film, this is an enjoyable mess. It aims to be toy nostalgia for little girls of all ages, escapist silliness, wild fantasy, social satire with well-staged musical production numbers, in fact a bizarre mix of elements which shoukdn't work together, but somehow do. It's bright, colourful, tuneful, quite funny, well played, sometimes thoughtful and thought-provoking, mikdly feminist (though not without taking pokes at feminism and vacuous femininity as well as toxic masculinity) and, broadly, good-hearted. Helen Mirren's narration is dry and funny, and the last line is a killer.Looking at the film as a social phenomenon, I have two observations. One, a lot of people have got their knickers in a twist, and they are mostly males who feel very threatened by the mildly feminist message in this movie ABOUT DOLLS. This film is not is big a deal as it thinks it is, and it's certainly not as big a deal as wounded males seem to think it is. Two the cinema was packed (two-thirds female) and the audience seemed to enjoy it. The only films I have seen filling cinemas in recent years have been aimed at female audiences. No comment!\", \"Let's start with what I enjoyed. The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn't enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.\", 'I have seen this film in theaters twice now and I can safely say that I thought it was amusing, entertaining, and fun. However, I won\\'t lie to you and say that it\\'s really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn\\'t a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a \"good movie\" with. Now I can\\'t say that I wasn\\'t entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women\\'s issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an \"everyone movie\", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don\\'t get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of \"Barbieland\". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they\\'re toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn\\'t want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to \"do anything to see it in theaters again\", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not.', 'I saw this film with an open mind. I was ready for it to be enjoyable in some sort of way, either visually, through the actors, perhaps a fun story, or just turning off the brain and seeing what they came up with. Unfortunately, it struck out on all accounts. The much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast. The actors were so clichéd and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch (as you may have heard, Ryan Gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name). The movie was not fun after the first 15 minutes. In fact, it was intentionally written to be painful and to express the writer/director\\'s personal concerns. We were supposed to be frustrated but were not rewarded with any payoff at the end.Most concerning is that Barbie was clearly modeled after the first Matrix movie but in all the worst ways. Barbie\\'s world is a binary place composed of Barbieland, where the embodiments of the toys live and what they call \"The Real World\". The Real World is name of the place they travel to in Matrix as well but, in Barbie, it\\'s not a dark hellish landscape run by machines. Instead, it resembles our actual real world in appearance but it seems to be run by the evil toy company Mattel. Also, the men are all shown to be domineering, rude, and chauvinistic. It\\'s clearly supposed to represent our real world but goes so far into fantasy that it\\'s as unrealistic as the one in The Matrix. A man walking by Barbie sexually harasses her and slaps her on the backside. She then gets arrested for defending herself (what??). While shes being arrested, the male officers comment on her body and sexually harass her more. The toy company executives all wear suits like the Agents in The Matrix and work in unrealistic barren, industrial looking cubicles. They also drive black SUVs around with no regard for law and order as though they are in charge of the world. We get many heavy handed speeches about how badly women are treated in The Real World and I lost count of the number of times the word \"patriarchy\" was used. I know the director wanted to express her thoughts about western society but it was such a dystopian, bleak world that it was impossible to compare it to our world. In The Matrix, there was depth and nuance to both worlds but in Barbie there was mostly sadness in both. The movie shows a fake world dominated by women in the beginning, then a fake world dominated by men as it progresses, and completes by showing us that the two are completely incompatible. The bright, colorful, happy movie we were shown in the promotional material is actually dark, depressing, and irredeemable. If it was meant to reflect our real world, well, it\\'s so far out there that it doesn\\'t even come close. If its mean to show a fantasy world, the fantasy is that there is incompatibility and depression between the sexes with no solution available. It was difficult to complete watching Barbie because it tried to say so much that, in the end, it said nothing at all. It was a fantasy film with only an unhappy, sad fantasy to show once all the pastel colors and fashionable outfits had faded.', \"This movie is not for people who cry a lot. It was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic gold.Starting with Barbie land, it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy. While the Barbies are in control there Is a lack of violence between the Kens and the Barbies. The most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between Ryan Goslings Ken and Simu Liu's Ken. Although, the Kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like 'beach' which is a role reversal of the human world. Barbie's entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see Barbie spiral out of control.Side note: the whole concept of weird Barbie's house is amazing, the discontinued Barbie's and Ken's are hilarious especially when you realise their backstories.Then the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements. Under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful. Barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through. We also see Barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit. This is when Ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more. The sequences in the human world aren't as interesting as Barbie world but still keep you hooked in.Then going back to Barbie world we see Ken's patriarchy. Unlike the Barbie's matriarchy it is completely toxic. The Barbies are all maids and 'stupid' only ever caring for the Kens. And then the Kens actually start a war with eachother over the Barbies. However the Kens are actually stupid and clearly don't see what they want. Ryan Gosling's Ken then explains to Barbie that he didn't like how he was treated before and he doesn't like the world he's built for himself now, and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world. The Barbies still run everything but they give the Kens more opportunities (the Kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions). This is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote now.....Finally the ending where Barbie is taken away by Ruth is beautiful. This made me cry the most, watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out. This movie is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar this year more than any other.\", \"Amazing to watch and delved into womanhood using incredible references. Weird Barbie was such a humorous touch but every part of humour managed to add to the true meaning of the film. Even weird barbie highlighted how barbie was exploited by some users for their enjoyment using her ridiculing and yet she's seen as ugly despite the true fun and amusement she's brought to the world. Amazing soundtrack aswell though I felt some songs couldn't be heard very well at all. Amazing performance from Margot Robbie but as Helen Mirren said she was the wrong person to cast for sympathy during that scene where she calls herself ugly!\", \"Went in to see for Margot Robbie, left giving flowers to Ryan GoslingGreta Gerwig's Barbie is a one of a kind type of movie and arguably the movie of the summer. Greta brings the world of Barbie to life with its visually dazzling cinematography, amusing soundtrack and choreographies, and lively, hot pink set pieces. The film's satire commentary tackles on sexism, societal norms, and existentialism that will connect with the viewers while also give them a good amount of chuckles here and there. And last and certainly not least, the entire ensemble brought their Barbie and Ken game with Robbie and Gosling giving Oscar worthy performances. Barbie is a movie I'd watch in theaters!\", 'Alas, my high hopes were crushed. When i heard about this project, I saw the opportunity, and expected, rather hoped for, an utterly ridiculous over the top comedy where dollified actors could come up with some novel situations. I wanted to see what kind of comedic chops Gosling would trot out. Instead, after a razzmatazz showbiz intro, dancing dolls and high energy, the sad, busy, and quizzical plot unfolds as a very sorry melodrama. An emotionally vulnerable and beautiful but pitiful Barbie, and a truly oafish Ken, have passed through a \"Dimensional Membrane\" onto the earth plane, into a reality just as bizarre and unrealistic as the Barbie-Dimension, and the two doll-humanoids find themselves maladaptive and disliked, even persecuted. And they have come looking for a solution to an unpleasant sort of problem. This just isn\\'t funny. It\\'s pretty much a reworking of Judy Garland in OZ, way out of her element, trying to find the Ruby Slippers. In fact, it was a deformation of her feet as a Doll in Barbieland, that kicks off this whole sorry setup. Now I have to ask myself why I was expecting a comedy? Well, because the advertising suggested something ludicrous. When you see Will Ferrell doing pratfalls and the entire surreal pink Landscape of Barbie Land, Gosling with idiotic facial expressions and gestures, and Barbie presented as a very sexualized Super-Bimbo, sort of a witless Mae West, (who was very witty), I thought some very funny stuff was coming down the pike. Nope. I wouldn\\'t say avoid it, but I would say it never really finds it\\'s tone, and doesn\\'t live up to its advertised premise. The crowd around me wanted to laugh, that was clear, and was struggling to find something funny in things that just weren\\'t. This must have cost a fortune to produce. The money could have been better spent.', \"I am so torn, on this movie. There is no doubt, that Barbie is beautifully made movie, with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team. Margo Robbie was born to play Barbie and lets be honest Ryan Gosling stole the entire movie. Then again I can't think of a single cast Member I didn't like. The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either. I think the target audience will love it, and lets be honest thats not me.\", 'I was never into Barbie as a child because I thought she\\'s just a boring toy. The operative word being - toy. So when the controversy started about her impossibly small waist, sky high beauty standards, white skin and blonde hair, I thought some people just have too much time on their hands or because they\\'re just jealous at someone else\\'s success. It\\'s easier to blast someone else\\'s hard work rather than strike it out on your own and keep doing it.The way children perceive toys remain unchanged. A young child who picks up a Barbie will not immediately think (if at all) they must aspire to have the doll\\'s physique. Children play with toys out of enjoyment and by using their innocent imagination, they don\\'t think about the underlying message or intention behind every toy. The politicising comes from some adults who can scream the loudest and longest. Ruth Handler created Barbie after seeing her daughter playing with a paper doll, she wasn\\'t into politics or trying to change cultural standards.Gerwig\\'s Barbie is an example of an adult using a doll to scream her many, many lectures to the masses. The movie looks like it\\'s for children and teenagers but the script is the opposite. This is where it becomes confusing and the storyline thin. Too many speeches aiming at the patriarchy control, pointing out that it\\'s a sexist world controlled by men but showing all men in this movie as idiots.The portrayal of men is very black and white stereotyping. Barbie (Robbie) goes into the real human world and she\\'s heckled by men at the beach and if that\\'s not a clear enough message, she visits a construction site where, you guessed it, the men starts to make derogatory comments as well. Then there\\'s the Mattel HQ where it\\'s of course run by men in suits who are naturally, idiots. One of the lower ranked male employee (Swindells) even say, \"I\\'m a man with no power, does that make me a woman?\" (What\\'s with half of the Sex Education actors cast in this movie. The brilliant Ncuti Gatwa playing a hetero Ken!?)At just under two hours, you can guess why that is - there\\'s not much else going for it so the soundtrack plays a big part in driving the narrative to the point, you\\'re wondering if this is a movie or a music channel. The second half descends into a weird but clumsy attempt at humour that a child would find boring.Robbie and Gosling do a decent job with the flat material they were given. Barbie is an iconc doll and that\\'s all she is, a toy - so a movie keeping to that theme without the controversy would have been more entertaining. And in case you\\'re so numb from all the preachiness, the Trump and his wall sideswipe under a guise of a joke shows how the writers just wanted to cover as many \\'isms\\' as possible by using Barbie as a prop.', 'The story in Barbie isn\\'t about a doll. It\\'s about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.We created them, and we can change them. We can make them what ever we want them to be. We can make ourselves what ever we want to be. The tag line for the barbie doll is \"You can be anything.\" That in the point of the movie. You can be anything.', 'The colourful & musical \"Barbie\" is set in the plastic uptopia of Barbieland - a Helen Mirren narrated doll\\'s world of: \\'Stereotypical Barbie\\' Margot Robbie; token Kens like Ryan Gosling (with HIS token Michael Cera) & John Cena; empowered Barbies like Issa Rae & Alexandra Shipp; and \\'Weird Barbie\\' Kate McKinnon - into which existential confusion seeps (with Mattel CEO Will Ferrell) via a portal to the real world (thru America Ferrera (great)). Greta Gerwig directs with striking bright vibrancy, but her co-writing (with Noah Baumbach) is bogged in its \\'struggle against the patriarchy\\' theme (despite a light veneer). It\\'s fun - but with a heavy-handed message.', 'I went to see Barbie in theaters today, and it is one of the best comedies of this year.The story is really good, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did awesome as Barbie and Ken, respectively, the production design is amazing, Greta Gerwig\\'s direction was pretty good, and the soundtrack was great. Billie Eilish\\'s song \"What Was I Made For\" was also so good.Barbie is one of the best movies of 2023, and my fifth favorite movie of 2023 so far. I recommend going to see it in theaters. Even anyone who isn\\'t a fan of the Barbie dolls will enjoy this movie. This is also the 2007 live-action Bratz movie done right.', \"Barbie vs Oppenheimer, was an amazing event to take place, if you want to say they were even going against each other, it was very enjoyable to see this take place though.But as for Barbie the movie was okay in my opinion, it was no doubt hilarious and joyful, I would probably rewatch it for that reason. But the movie itself just kind of lacked something, I think the story was okay, had some good messages. Some parts just didn't work well, the storyline of the daughter didn't make sense, because one scene she's mean and terrible then all of the sudden she's nice, just didn't work that well.But overall it was just okay, probably won't watch it again.\", \"This movie, wow. Just wow. This was unlike anything I had expected going in to seeing Barbie earlier today. I figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between Barbie and Ken with it ending with them getting together, beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever afterBoy was I wrong. Holy moly, Barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking, at least to me it was deep and thought provoking. I mean seriously, this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie. Yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times. But the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following - self identity, discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life. It is ok to be imperfect, to be weird, kooky, dark, it's ok to not live up to anyone's expectations in life or those around you. Just be you and only you. Self love. Willing to accept change even if you dont like it. There's also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mixIt's funny, heartwarming, filled with unexpected surprises and Im sure for all the hardcore Barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant movieMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did an exceptional job as Barbie and Ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time. Ryan Gosling as Ken especially is definitely one of the main highlights of the movie as you can tell he had fun in the role as Ken.\", 'I wasn\\'t expecting much, but this movie is great! It\\'s a smart comedy. The film is clearly feminist, but it is NOT \"preachy\" as some other reviewer complained. Yes, there is one speech, but it\\'s not made by a Barbie. It fits into the story.The film mines the Barbie and Ken existence of \"life\" as a plastic doll for comedic effect, with some song and dance sequences as a bonus. But it\\'s mainly about an existential crisis for the main Barbie (Margot Robbie), who travels to the \"Real World\" to resolve her crisis. Events in both the \"Real World\" and the Barbie world drive the plot, which concerns the collision between the ideal and the real. The dramatic conflict centers on the contradiction between the ideal world of the Barbies and the disappointing, yet also tempting, reality of our world--the Real World. I thought the last scene was perfect and perhaps slyly politically incorrect. You can judge for yourself. I only didn\\'t like the music played over the end credits. The song and dance numbers in the film were entertaining though.', \"Ryan Gosling acting was so good that is seemed that he as Ken is the main character.Physically Margot was a great choice, but she didn't give much. Even when she had the opportunity to act more human, her expressions and acting were still more as a doll, and Ryan did a better job.I didn't know what to expect but I was hoping that it will not be too superficial, and it wasn't. The movie is light, with some smart things said. It was a bit too long and became little boring in the middle but after all it was fun to watch. Loved the music, costumes, choreography. Girls can relate to many things said in the movie, and I recommend you to watch it in girls company, you will have fun.\", \"As a young child I played with barbies. Had the house had a Ken and had the car etc but this film didn't create any humorous nostalgia at all. Soo many opportunities were missed. The looks were pretty bland and it could have been pushed soo much further. Yes there was a message but the message was relentlessly dragged on and on and everything was just, well a bit meh! The story didn't make much sense and there were no laugh out loud moments more of little ha moments that passed quickly like a pretty dull knock knock joke that you'll forget in a second. Such a shame. All of it was just.... bland.\", 'I don\\'t think I\\'ve been this excited about a movie in a long while.It was somewhat different than what I was expecting, but in some fantastic ways. Margot Robbie was a fantastic choice as Barbie. She shines, she makes you fall in LOVE with Barbie again, effervescent in every moment, she fully enveloped how a lot of us remember playing with Barbie, and what we thought and hoped for when we grew up.America Ferrera - fantastic. She brought me to tears\\nRyan Gosling was a scene stealer! His Kenergy was phenomenal - in a movie where he was literally \"and Ken\"\\nGreta Gerwig truly brought the entire Barbieland to life.I laughed, I cried , I ugly cried and I\\'m still revisiting every moment.', \"A fun and clever enough comedy and twist on the world's most famous doll with wonderful production values, a charming Margot Robbie and an absolute hilarious Ryan Gosling.Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.Cinematography is great here, Set pieces are outstanding and the Soundtrack is a masterpiece.I want to take a minute to take about Greta Gerwig she is so clever and talented hope this movie will push her to direct big blockbuster movies that she deserves.\", \"Greta Gerwig, you've done it again. There's a reason this movie has become such a phenomenon in modern culture and that's because it's always been a hit!The writing is absolutely genius with the right mix of attention-to-detail and suspension of disbelief for the imagination. The cast is so random but that makes it perfect, there's a Barbie or Ken for everyone no matter what. Their acting is superb too, everyone's line delivery left me cracking up each time.Go to the cinema and watch this film - I was fortunate enough to go to a screening where everyone shared my excitement and there were cheers in the crowd and applause at the end. It's an experience I will never forget. Thank you Greta Gerwig for my life.\", 'Really didn\\'t know what to make of \"Barbie\", given the marketing, so it was never really on my radar. But eventually, my kid goes on about it at length and the cultural fervor starts getting the the ol\\' curiosity piqued. So, here we are ...And it delivers; I think it\\'s a fun movie with great dance numbers, phenomenal sets and excellent performances from both Robbie and Gosling. I love the use of practical effects in creating a living playset, and most of the jokes at Mattel\\'s expense land pretty well.The most common criticism I\\'ve heard is that it\\'s preachy; and maybe it is. All I can say for certain is that it spoke to everyone in my household (we\\'re all feminists here). We can probably all agree it is a lot better than a Mattel movie has any right to be and honestly, Margot Robbie is fantastic.', \"Leading up to the day I went to see this movie, I avoided as much advertising as I could as to avoid spoilers and go in entirely blind. But that being said, I learned very late that Greta Gerwig was the director of this film, and therefore, was not prepared for the emotional journey I was about to be taken through.This movie was unique, creative, fun, and so special. The music was excellent, the cast was wonderful, the costumes were amazing, it was funny, and the choreography was fun.As for it's flaws, this movie did have some uneven pacing. I felt that some side plot stuff was unnecessary (namely, most of the Mattel chase). Sometimes it was just very confusing for the sake of making audience members existential, the ending felt abrupt, and there was little justice by the end of the movie (though perhaps this was more of a conscious choice on behalf of the filmmakers to convey the endless, feminist fight).I was happy to see how this film really explored the female experience. From growing up to objectification by men. I was shocked to see Ken claim to love Barbie, only to objectify and hurt her later on; it was truly reminiscent of many elements in real life. Overall the tone and look of this movie was very unique and I enjoyed it a lot.I didn't expect to cry during the fun, silly Barbie movie I had been so excited to see, but I'm glad it was as emotional as it was.\", 'Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig. And the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we\\'ll catch glimpses of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Truman Show\"; we\\'ll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy\\'s films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it\\'s a lot. \"Barbie\" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today\\'s society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms \"Barbie\" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast \"Real Time\" in which he said: \"Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment\". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that\\'s undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idiots, greedy, dumb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig\\'s goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the \"Stereotyped\" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you\\'re a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can\\'t just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn\\'t encompass the mandatory \"diversity and inclusion\" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn\\'t be \"empowering\" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the \"evil patriarchy\". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the \"toxic\" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film\\'s script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile \"conservative fascist\". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the \"evil businessmen\" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria\\'s feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are \"dumb\". The Barbies\\' plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).\"Barbie\" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.\"Barbie\" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one\\'s social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, \"Barbie\" doesn\\'t even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. \"Who is Barbie?\": the only possible conclusion is that it is a toy that has ensured at least two more decades of popularity.', 'I initially thought this movie was this movie was about Barbie finding out that she was a toy, but she actually already knows that! Anyway, this movie was about Barbie getting real emotions and going to the real world to find the girl (revealed to be a grown woman) who\\'s playing with her Barbie toy wrong. There\\'s a halfway plot switch, as the second half is about Ken (well, the Kens) taking over Barbieland and changing it to Kenland. I admit that the second half isn\\'t as good as the first. The movie probably could have been trimmed by twenty minutes and it would have been better. Will Ferrell is in this, but the problem is that he isn\\'t used more.Wait, he was in \"Stranger Than Fiction\", a movie about a guy who found out his life was being controlled by a writer. He was in \"The Lego Movie\" as the father of a son playing Legos who found out they were alive. Now he\\'s in this movie about Barbie finding out her purpose. Is this all the same character?! Anyway, the Kens aren\\'t really villains and it\\'s nice to see such a beautiful looking movie with great costumes, some great jokes and a fairly unique setup. Yes, the \"Barbie Girl\" does appear as a remix in the credits! ***', 'I watched this movie expecting something else, but after the movie was finished I was not expecting so much humor, emotional rollercoasters, and a lot of Barbies with Kens. The last scene where Barbie wants to be a human had me almost in tears. I felt different in the heart as well. The soundtrack was also amazing as well. I just wish that there could be more Barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales. If not \"Blame Mattel\" lol. The Mattel jokes had me laughing every time they were brought up. I couldn\\'t have asked for a better comedy movie for the summer.', \"With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth. Very curious to know the film's future: if it will be forgetfull or timeless as Barbie, the doll, has been.\", \"For starters this movie was made by women for women. I was not the intended audience, which is fine. But I feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here, or there could have been one. That everyone could have really liked.The movie is well made; I could tell that the people who made the movie liked Barbie, and knew their stuff. And that bleed into the movie. It has a cool set, lot's of creative choices and has good actors. With some genuinely funny gags and jokes.The cons: Some movies are great pieces of art, where you can't nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say. The classic disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan Pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themes.Then there some films like Atlas Shrugged where you know exactly what it's trying to say from the get-go. This is one of the those films, except it doesn't just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another. This film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it up.I don't think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be. And it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical. And all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way. There was even this car chase scene in middle which I believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for Chevrolet.Also there were some very weird parts of the movie. Where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways. I'll just give one example and finish on that. At the end Barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have. But she is wrong, everything she listed weren't women problems they were people problems. That's life. I sorry but it's not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss. Go talk to Machiaveli. These are problems everyone has.Anyway that's my review. I hope it's balanced and fair and gave you a good idea about what this film is .\", \"How did I go to watch Barbie, only to have seen a mildly depressing unecessarily deep movie saturated with politics and talk of mental health. The plot made no sense.For someone who has grown up and loved watching all the classics, it was a disappointment. Most women like to watch feel-good chick flicks as an escape from reality, and for the same reason, girls like to watch Barbie. But it was nothing like that, and instead I left the cinema feeling LITERALLY depressed. As a little girl, not a single part of me thought the old Barbie movies presented a Barbie who wasn't a strong figure. And yes, you can be strong, WHILE being in love.The way the movie was filmed was truly a work of art, but the plot made NO sense despite them trying to constantly spoon-feed it to us.In Barbie land the women (the barbies) are in charge and have everything while the men (the Kens) are nobodies with absolutely no power and are treated like nobodies. They dont even have houses. When Barbie enters the real word, she realises its the complete reverse. You'd think that Barbie would then REALISE that how she was being treated is how the barbies were treating the kens, then go back to Barbie land and FIX it. Instead, when she goes back to see Ken turning Barbie-land into Ken-land (because the poor sod had a taste of what it feels like to be appreciated when he was in the real world), she has a crisis and then gathers the barbies to MANIPULATE the kens into FIGHTING each other so they can take back their power. Then instead of apologising to Ken (who was genuinely in love with her and had no TRUE bad intentions the entire movie - he thought the patriarchy was about horses) about how she constantly brushed him off like an annoying child every 5 seconds, she simply apologises for not spending some time with him, then continues to reject him and tells him he essentially needs to FIND himself. Then she wants to become human despite fighting to maintain her perfection throughout the movie, simply because someone told her its ok to be imperfect - and I get what they're trying to achieve here but I thought there would be a deeper reason? Perhaps there are things about being an imperfect human that are valuable? Such as having empathy, or maybe make it obvious that she was becoming a more realistic role model for little girls by becoming human with cellulite?I get the intention of the movie, but it really didn't have to be that deep? I REALLY just wanted to have fun at a Barbie movie. The last thing you'd want to go watch after a long day at work or school is a movie about a silly fight between men and women, politics, patriarchy, death, depression and anxiety. The beginning of the film was fun, but that fun didn't last long. But people are probably gonna call us the brainwashed barbies because we actually want men to be our equals.\", \"If this was an ad for Mattel, then fair play! They've done a great job.As a film...pretty terrible! Started off in a silly critical mode, and then went downhill.Pretending to be political, social etc but doesn't even get near. Trying to be serious when all it's managing to do is show everyone as stupid and self centred.What is more depressing is how people find this funny. We've completely lost our humour and taste of what is funny and what is not.Very disappointed. In the past we used to rate these films as B or C movies. I can hardly find the courage to rate this one! Such a waste of time...\", 'Pushing all of the serious reviews aside for a moment, this is a classic comedy of the thirties, updated for our times. Screwball comedies like \"Bombshell\" with Harlow and \"My Man Godfrey\" were wonderful satires. They centered around a battle of the sexes, with a female character dominant over the male lead. They were loaded with farcical situations and spoofing, as well as lots of physical comedy.And like \"Christmas in Connecticut\", they often had a gentle but serious \\'message\\' at the end, and America loved it. The woman is always smarter, generally with a plan up her sleeve, the male lead (most of the men in the movie) are oblivious. The more self-important, the more obliviousness they are to what\\'s really going on around them. I\\'d now love to see Ryan Gosling in a re-make of \"It Happened One Night\", he\\'d be terrific. Or Margot Robbie in a re-make of \"Some Like It Hot\".', \"Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.\", \"I somehow managed to convince my immensely macho friend to watch this film with me and boy was it an amazing experience! Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud. I would highly recommend that everyone watch this film, it's quite the experience.\", 'Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are most charming and superb in their roles as Barbie and Ken. Also here and there are some really funny and entertaining scenes, but the \"message\" (you know all that blabla about patriarchy and matriarchy and all the cliches regarding gender from a certain point of view) drag the whole movie rather down - at least for me. For sure the movie is one great coup by the marketing team of Mattel to fit and place Barbie World into the currents of today\\'s zeitgeist (like all those Barbie dolls they sell these days that are inclusive) - I take any bet, the sells will rise these days profoundly. Anyway, if you are in the mood for comedy and can cope with those \"preachy elements\" especially in the second half of the movie, you may find some good entertainment (like I did), but if you are really fed up with such \"progressive\" matters, you should avoid watching this one. Because of Robbie and Gosling and some fine settings and scenes this movie does not crash but Barbie is without doubt just another most hyped affair by the media, and the plot rather a very predictable one, if you think about it.', 'This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song \"You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,\" but at some point I realize it\\'s way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it\\'s so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it\\'s so beautiful. Yet, it\\'s such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It\\'s a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It\\'s a masterpiece.', \"Barbie was a fun movie and it visually looked really original. There were some really funny parts and some good acting. I loved some of the throwbacks and songs. Really was laughing at some of the funny moments.The story and pacing was a little off and uneven for me. Couple of the characters felt a little flat to me, but overall it was a well made movie. Some of the songs were really great and the camera work was really good as well. I wish the story felt a little more connected overall. The tone really shifted around a bunch of times and it got a bit distracting. A movie can be funny and serious.. but it just didn't seem to know what tone it wanted to be and was a bit conflicting to me. Overall still enjoyed myself.\", \"The movie is entertaining, most often when it just embraces the absurdity of the doll world. However, the feminist messaging is so heavy handed it feels like parody most of the time. Ken discovering the patriarchy was amusing but the joke goes too far, and again the only way I can describe it is that the message feels like a parody of itself, but you can tell that it's meant to be taken seriously.I still think the movie is fun and genuinely amusing in places. But the most I enjoyed it was when we were with the Kens which I feel is a misfire in Barbie's movie.I almost wish they had just made a comedic film, set mostly in Barbieland, and left the human characters out.I admire what they tried to do, but the tones of the silly Barbie movie and the critique of society segments didn't mesh well.\", \"Just saw 'Barbie' today directed by Greta Gerwig. It is a bit difficult to rate. Slow to start - a tedious first 30 or 40 mins. Didn't like the lift from 2001 either. But the latter half with Gosling somewhat makes up for the beginning. His musical number was fantastic.Aspects of it reminded me of Pleasantville, PeeWee Herman's Big Adventure, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and even a bit from the Matrix - some interesting associations.Overall kinda liked the movie but can only give it a fair rating. The Mattel chasing subplot was superfluous and detracting coupled with the slow start needing rework. Could have used better conflict focus and editing on the story I think. Needed to cut some of the vague ideas or loose ends and focus on theme of interpretation and melding of materialism/paternalism. Overall Mixed.\", \"Barbie, while not something I would typically watch, caught my interest. I watched the trailer and felt as though this would not be a typical kids movie. The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.I will say that the humor is catered to parents in some aspects. The kids also have humor that they will enjoy. This movie is mainly for preteen/teenagers. Some parents of kids that are 10 years of age or younger may find the movie offensive.Overall, solid movie with a great cast and a good script. No doubt a movie that was need for this summer's box office.\", 'I think the extensive hype and the long standing popularity of the Barbie brand are responsible for bringing several generations of fans into the theaters resulting in the opening sales. It certainly isn\\'t the movie, itself. The storyline was overly simplistic, poorly written and I didn\\'t find its style of absurd humor to be funny. The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays \"actress Barbie\" in everything she does, so it wasn\\'t anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all. The concept of patriarchy certainly isn\\'t anything new and IMO there are much better films on the subject - starting with any of the Jane Austin films and this director\\'s other film - Little Women.', \"There's so much to say about the movie, so many points to touch on that I don't know how to express it correctly.Let me start by discussing a few parts that I really liked. First of all, Ryan Gosling's performance was amazing; it overshadowed everything in the film. A masterful and remarkable performance. While not Margot Robbie's best performance, she did quite well too. I didn't find the other actors or actresses quite as impressive.Another aspect I found impressive was the costumes; in my opinion, the film definitely deserved an Oscar for them. They were the best costumes I've seen in a long time. Similarly, the color coordination was superb.I also enjoyed the production; most things were cohesive from a technical standpoint. The comedy in the film was of good quality, and there were scenes that I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun watching.Now, moving on to the things I didn't like, and the area I'd like to emphasize the most - the screenplay. After watching a strong first half, I became very invested in the movie, but the ending suffocated me. Trying to convey so many messages felt utterly pointless. The film had already managed to balance comedy and drama in the first half; there was no need to forcefully shove these messages down our throats in such a contrived manner. I understood the message, but I ended up leaving the theater feeling frustrated.In addition, there's a part I absolutely disliked: Barbie's convincing Kens with their beauty and then reclaiming Barbie Land. It felt too simplistic and contradicted the main point of the movie. It definitely could have been written more cleverly. Moreover, the metaphorical scene of Classic Barbie talking to the creator (metaphorically) and visiting a gynecologist was harsh and not smartly executed. It was emotional, yes, but personally, it felt heavy.In short, summing up the technical aspects and acting, the film scored a 6.5 to 7 from me. However, the disjointedness of the screenplay and its excessive urge to convey messages left me extremely disappointed. Women are our treasures; we should stand firm against discrimination and support each other. Let's love one another, let's love our women - they are our mothers. They are all invaluable, and so are we. Hopefully, one day everyone will be equal, just like Barbie's aim, and you can achieve your goals just like Ken does.Note: Regardless of everything, people should stop comparing Barbie and Oppenheimer ; Barbie ran a crazy advertising campaign, and it's necessary to admit that their popularity and the pink frenzy are owed to their advertising efforts.\", \"A confused, misfiring, tedious and pretentious affair. I was expecting much better, yet ultimately disappointed. Margot Robbie (and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling) is very good, but otherwise even she can't save this twaddle. Don't listen to the critics - it is crap!Pros: the opening scene apeing '2001 a Space Odyssey' was funny.Cons:\\nIt needed better editing to create a more coherent structure\\nIt had very dull patches (despite the pink)\\nThe emphasis on the 'patriarchy' was definitely laid on too thick\\nWill Ferrell was not funny in this. He needs to really understand that whatever comes out of his mouth is not necessarily instant comedy gold.Avoid!!!!!\", 'The start was a wonderfully fun look at Barbies & Kens in Barbieland but I felt that it was a bit abrupt when Barbie out of nowhere had thoughts of death would\\'ve made more sense for her to notice signs of imperfection first then thoughts of death.Film doesn\\'t hate men I actually really enjoyed how they handled Ken by showing how it is so easy for society to corrupt young teen men with people like Andrew Tate etc. Although ending was bad, why not have Kens and Barbies in charge together as going in the real world showed that men running it was bad & Barbieland was only a utopian for the Barbies. At one point Barbie is asked where do the Kens sleep and she thinks for a moment before saying \"I don\\'t know\" then that\\'s it we never learn, basically her saying \"I don\\'t know and I don\\'t care.\" They did so well showing Ken\\'s feelings of being inadequate, inferior and almost like a toy for Barbie to play with when she wanted and yet they just end with the Barbies taking back control of Barbieland, they give Ken\\'s low level government jobs because they should struggle like woman. So, the message is it\\'s okay for one gender to have to fight, claw and struggle for anything good as long as it\\'s men?Also this is entire my own preference and has no fault of story but most of the cast was a bit rubbish for me anyway. It was as if the casting director watched some British shows and picked actors from, like did we really need 3 sex education actors all of which were pretty bland?', \"So I watched this movie a few days ago and I think it is one of the most intelligent movies I have ever watched. From the first time I watched the trailer I knew this movie would be different I knew it wouldn't be just about a doll and it would have something more. And I was correct. These movie is about existational crisis, finding who you are and your purpose.And they do that amazingly good. In the end you just understand the character and you touched by her story. I cry at the end and I didn't expect that at all. In the end she just discovers that she doesn't need to be Barbie, she can be whoever she wants, this beautiful. How many times you're just leaving our lives thinking we can't be just more than what we already are.Everyone should give a chance to this movie.\", 'In my view there\\'s two ways to watch / interpret Barbie. First, watch it with a critical eye about how Mattel have realised that they have to move with the times and to sell more dolls they need to \\'normalise\\' Barbie. Second, just have fun. Both work. It is genius quite frankly. Mattel have taken criticism on the chin but ultimately know that they\\'ll be quids in with a new \\'flat footed\\' Barbie.You should watch it and work out where you stand. To refuse to watch it because it\\'s \"about a doll\" is missing the point in my view. It\\'s a great movie to just watch and have fun with but equally you could watch it with a critical eye and work out where you stand.', \"Anyone who gives this movie above a 1 star has a vested financial interest in its success. This was basically just a mess of a movie. All over the place plot with nonsense scenes and situations. There were some funny scenes but at its core, it just had no depth, logic or meaning other than Barbie v. Ken. Let's present a fake world where either men rule and women are puppets or women rule and men are puppets. This reads like someone's thesis on the state of feminism in modern society. I feel bad for the families that took their children to see this expecting something lighthearted and fun. This was not it. Just silly...\", \"To me, Barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men. I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.Men aside, i do think it healed something in me, however cliché it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it (would definitely show it to my future daughter, if i planned to have one). I think it's an incredible celebration of femininity and i think women deserve to enjoy every second of it without having to worry about anything or anyone else <3.\", 'Barbie is such a unique movie, it will probably become a very popular movie, at least a cult movie. Great songs ... it was a musical at times ... great talents. The jokes were embedded everywhere in the movie, the phrases, the T-shirts, the signs. I will have to watch the movie again to pickup on more of them.The movie starts with the individual issues with Barbie, and Ken, and then Ken\\'s feelings for Barbie, and the lack of feelings that Barbie has for Ken.They are dolls, so some of the premise of the movie is really inconsistent ... and so many people, including myself, are trying to latch on aspects of the movie that they want to champion. Folks are now getting serious about the movie and its messages. Those folks must be too young to have gone through the \\'70s.I am not a movie fanatic, so I am not aware of the possible meanings that the writers/directors had.IMO, this is a gynocentric film, but it is supposed to be a spoof. The Barbie environment was created in a time of typical male/women roles, but exploited to an extreme. Barbie was always slim, white, and had some room for possible growth. Ken was a complete air-brain, only to accompany Barbie, possibly so she wouldn\\'t look like a promiscuous woman.My daughter had no desire to play with dolls, especially Barbies, nor did I want her to; she had her favorite doll (not a Barbie), but it was more of a companion, she was not its mother. My son did not play with toy soldiers, he had no interest in them, nor did I want him to, nor playing with toy guns (probably not for the typical reasons). When he got older, it was limited to lasertag, with a clear distinction from reality.The movie skips around with Ken\\'s understanding of his lack of value, Barbie\\'s lack of affection for him; Barbie and Ken then learn about the \"real\" world. Barbie, of course, is devastated when she finds that real women don\\'t have the same life as in BarbieLand, where women control the world. In \"real\" life, they don\\'t do anything, they have no influence/power, important jobs (which can include just about anything), and are completely and utterly controlled by men. Right. That is realistic. The Kens find a completely different life as well, they actually can act like idiots.The Kens then go off on some idiotic campaign to overthrow the Barbies ... stupid, but funny. Great musical numbers. The Kens have been ignored for years, the Barbies objectified. This is when the film goes off on a gynocentric bent, only concentrating on the oppression that Barbies have had. Forget the Kens.The film apparently wants to get more philosophical/genuine at the end. This is ridiculous. There are booths at the theatre where photos can be taken, merchandise purchased, etc. This is nothing more than a money-making opportunity, keeping the same ideas. So now girls should be supporting this theme? Getting pictures taken with Barbie, wearing the pastel pink clothing that has been proven medically as causing epilepsy (a joke) ? I am not sure what new information the movie has for folks ... if any. Reading comments, some folks are actually considering the movie to exposing the problems of today. I hope society has progressed a bit further than the original Barbie concept, for both the Barbies and the Kens.This movie will become a cult classic.', 'I think Barbie has always been about women empowerment and I\\'m glad there\\'s a Barbie movie that doesn\\'t tiptoe around it to spare feelings. This movie was not marketed towards kids, it was clearly meant for adults who grew up with Barbie. It\\'s an important message and it was told well. The cinematography was also incredible. Loved the costumes, the casting, everything about it. Margot played a literal perfect Barbie. I loved the scene where she was supposed to be \"ugly\" and the narrator made a joke about Margot being the wrong person to cast if you wanted to make an ugly scene with her. Ryan gosling also have an amazing performance as Ken. Even when he was being a douche he still came across lovable.', \"Barbie is no longer just a toy; rather, this idea of 'Barbie' has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time. It is so much more than merely a toy. It will not longer be just 'a toy'I must admit, as i waited in the theatre for the movie to start showing, i had my doubts. So many things scanned through my head: one was that this movie will just be a lighthearted comedy; another was that the marketing for this movie is way too extravagant for a 'comedy'; and one of the biggest was that i would lose interest in this movie soon because i tend to lose track of comedies as it is really difficult for comedy films to impress me. Boy, was I wrong.Where do I start:To start off with, this is NOT just a comedy movie. Would everyone in the theatre have been in tears by the time the movie ended if it had been a simple comedy?This movie is appealing to spectators of varying ages because of its heartwarming plot, a plot that touches everyone's heart, a topic that is heavy in nature but simple in the showcasing of this topic throughout the movie.Barbie focuses on the story of Stereotypical Barbie & Ken... Barbie starts to experience strange thoughts and strange symptoms which causes her to travel to the real world with Ken to find the child who is playing with her doll and to fix the issue. When reading this plot, it is easy to imagine that this is just a comedy, action, simple film etc. However, this is only the PLOT... the storyline is very different.The opening scene itself focuses on a rather heavy topic of childhood, stereotypes, a new generation etc. With Barbie (Margot Robbie) appearing and the one of the little girls smashing her dolls to pieces, this was a very symbolic gesture to add right at the beginning of the film. It is is symbolic in the sense that, the young girl smashing her dolls represents a new generation in which dolls are not played with, it may also represent girls smashing or declining 'their dreams' due to female stereotypes (a topic that is heavy in this film) - I liked that Gerwig made it clear in the first 10 seconds of the movie that this film is not one to be taken lightly.Good comedic scenes are present throughout the film. Such as the jokes about Alan... however, even though Alan being on his own and not many people caring about Alan are seen as 'comedy' - I feel that there is much more behind Alan, and that making his scenes comedic are just a barrier, and that Gerwig wants spectators to take apart these scenes and to analyse what is behind that wall. That being Alan may represent 'women' in the sense that in this male-dominant world, women are constantly feeling pressured and alone, and not listened to.I like how Gerwig didn't make a whole 'new' concept of Barbie... this added to the topic of childhood and simplicity. I particularly liked how when Barbie floats from the top of her dream house to her car, this was symbolic as when young children play with Barbies, that is how they get their Barbie doll down too, they bring the barbie down as if it is floating, I really liked this detail, had innocence to it.Further on in the movie, the topics start to get heavier: For example when Barbie meets Sasha. Sasha described first world problems such as feminism, here Gerwig had SUDDENLY brought in these topics, without warning. Again, I liked this because it shows how suddenly this world makes decisions regarding women's rights, and how quick this world is to judge women.Ken's storyline was also an intricate part of the movie, the 2nd half of the movie is solely based on Ken wanting to not just be Ken and Barbie, but wanting to feel important. In the end, Ken realises that he is important too. Gerwig does this really well.... Although this movie highlights topics relating to women's rights, the end juxtaposes that in a sense and just shows that everyone is equal, and that was a nice message to finish the film off.The ending montage of childhood, barbies, children etc was a really heart-wrenching moment, a great way to end the movie... Gerwig played with emotions here, spectators started off the movie laughing, and ended in crying. Great way to showcase opposing topics.All in all, fantastic movie.\", 'Barbie has color and some music and dancing. There\\'s no movie in there though, as taken as a whole it\\'s a mess of illogic and heavy handed pronouncements. The \"real word\" is as fake as a 3 dollar bill. A universe called real world might be thought of as portraying, well, the real world, but it doesn\\'t. When straining for humor, it mostly doesn\\'t work. Furthermore, none of the characters in Barbie are interesting or someone one wants to relate to in a narrative. Some of the historical Barbie items are interesting to look at. Why this movie is popular I don\\'t know, but the film will soon be forgotten.', \"Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.\", 'This might just be the best movie I\\'ve ever seen. The more I think about it, the more I realize just how genius it is! I mean they really thought out every little detail!My favorite part is that: if you love this movie, you get the movie. And if you hate the movie, you also get the movie. It truly is a movie for people who love it and hate it. It\\'s for everyone.I\\'d like to talk about the genius of this plot for a moment. We start off in a matriarchal society. However, it\\'s a society created by little girls, so the Barbies are not violent towards the Kens. They just aren\\'t obsessed with the Kens. The Kens are just in the background, this is representative of how children girls feel. Then, we go into the real world and we are introduced to a patriarchal society. But not just any patriarchal society. It\\'s a society created by adults. So we see toxic masculinity and we see violent tendencies. Then, we go back to Barbieland and Ken brings all of his knowledge of the patriarchy with him. He creates a toxic meninist movement, which emphasizes the point that extremism is not the answer. We cannot overcorrect a mistake or it will cause more mistakes. The Kens start to become violent, even towards each other. This is a good representation of what women deal with in the real world. We can\\'t even rely on each other sometimes. Women can be hateful towards each other as well. Finally, the movie comes to a close with Barbie taking a small step in the right direction. She says it doesn\\'t have to be \"Barbie and Ken\", \"it\\'s Barbie and it\\'s Ken\". Now here\\'s we\\'re people start to get pissed. Barbie just got done saying that the Barbie\\'s and Ken\\'s need to start living as equals, but when when of the Kens asks to be on the Supreme Court the President Barbie says no that\\'s too far, let\\'s start with maybe a cabinet member or something.... Wow how could they... just kidding. You\\'re SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY about this! This is an accurate representation of the real world! The movie literally ends with the Barbie world being an exact replica of the real world, only with the gender roles reversed.Another thing I\\'d like to point out is that even Ken says at the end that he didn\\'t really like patriarchy anyway. He just wanted to ride horses. Again, this is because he is a doll in a world created by children. I think there\\'s a lot to unpack here but my overall take was that the world is a better place from the POV of a child and adults are the ones who are ruining everything. Even Mattel is kind of shown as a \"bad guy\" in the movie, but even they say, they didn\\'t make Barbie for her to become a sexualized standard. They made Barbie to allow girls to dream of more than just being a mother. With Barbie they can be anything they want to be. It wasn\\'t until adults came along and taught us to sexualize Barbie, that we started to hold her to a different standard.I think most people watch this movie and see the beauty and the genius of it. I think a few hateful people will watch this movie with their tainted glasses and their preconceived biases and they will get very close to understanding it. Every person I\\'ve see criticizing this movie, I\\'m like you\\'re SO CLOSE to the point. You\\'re basically running head first into it. That is the most frustrating and the most gratifying thing about this movie. It\\'s a trap. You can\\'t say hateful things about it, without PROVING THE POINT OF THE MOVIE!', \"Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?\", \"When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it.\", 'This is a weirdly complicated film. I wish I could say that was meant to be a compliment, but I found myself trying to figure out where all the pieces fit as the story unraveled.The basic premise seems simple enough and the jokes in the first 30 minutes were pretty funny, but then you introduce \"real world\" characters into the movie after the first act (as shown in the trailer) and it seems to lose its way. Add to that an oversimplification of the male predicament and expected role in society set against an attempt at a nuanced view of the female\\'s expected role and you\\'re left with...mush?Again, it has some decent satire one moment, but then also attempts to show heart the next. One example is how Ken discovers masculinity, but the way a 10 Year old boy might (trucks and horses), yet Barbie sometimes spouts off a simpleton\\'s take on Camus or Neitzche. Honestly, at some points, there\\'s a weird existential dread that flows out of her mouth, but Ken is kind of a moron.Anyone who views men and women like this in real life might have a hard time maintaining long term, meaningful relationships and should probably seek therapy.I wanted to like this more than I could.', 'Very well made. Terrific directing, acting and writing. It gets deeper at times, but the best part of it is that it isn\\'t trying to be heavy and \"meaningful\" the whole way through. It has a good balance of the more emotional moments with lighthearted humor.Synopsis:\\nBased on the Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel, it is the first live-action Barbie film after numerous computer-animated direct-to-video and streaming television films. Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.Leaping out of her pink plastic wonderland onto the big screen, the most famous doll in the world is ready to break free in Greta Gerwig\\'s epic live-action adventure, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. It\\'s time to put on your perfect summer outfit and channel your inner Barbie and Kenergy!', \"When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.Of course, this is all the plot oversimplified to its core. The moments of unabashed humor, and there is lots of it, speak for Gerwig's witted personality...unfortunately the preachy tone carried throughout the movie also does too. The film has its moments, even if the ending leaves some viewers indifferent. It's probably worth the watch if you just want a few chuckles and nothing more.\", \"The marketing team for this movie really need to take a bow because I honestly can't believe how this movie made so much money. It was like watching a really long toy commercial. The plot itself had some promise and there were some laughs but in general the movie was quite stupid.To start with there we're not enough big laugh moments and most of the humour was quite slapstick and lame. Secondly there seemed to be no real payoffs or explaining of choices. The only character who seemed to act in a way that was rationale was Ken, but even at the end he just gave up there was no conclusion so to speak of.The sets were quite fun and well thought out. But overall I was pretty bored and mostly waiting for the movie to be over. If you really want to watch this, wait for it to come out on the plane or on streaming platforms, don't bother spending your hard earned money on this garbage.\", 'This film exceeded all of my expectations A N D I was looking forward to seeing it. I wonder about any parents who might bring their children to see it expecting something quite different from what this film is. One hour fifty four minutes of fun from beginning to end. Satire, sarcasm , humor at every turn. Production values and acting off the charts good. I can\\'t believe Mattel let them make the movie with complete artistic freedom. Think of Nicole Kidman in the AMC promo before a movie starts and says, \" Somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this \". Well somehow watching a silly spoof like this movie feels great all the way through and even afterwards. I loved it and I am not surprised at the huge box office , this movie rocks.', \"I was excited by the hype from this movie. It seemed early reviews were enthusiastic about the themes and tone of the movie. The first 30 minutes were slow, the middle frenetic, and the last boring.It seemed like it just drags and I still doesn't seem to have a cohesive message and some of the characters really had no contribution or purpose. I was sorely disappointed. Over-hyped, and unsurprising my wife even fell asleep.... My teens left without a sense of what the story was. It was jumbled and I feel reviewers are praising it for the sake of praising a female empowering movie but those have been done much better before and without being tacky.\", \"I took my whole family to this movie thinking it was something we all could enjoy at least a little. My two girls are 6 and 8... I realized going in that it's mostly for adults but I wasn't expecting it to be totally for adults given the theme. Too bad. My oldest daughter was so disappointed by it that she was crying after and didn't understand it to be honest - she thought it was going to be more fun because we watched the trailers over and over. I mean it was a fantastic production and a lot of creativity went into making the Barbie world but why did they have to make the Barbie characters so introspective. So much crying and melodramatic parts for a movie that should be geared towards a kids imagination. And why did the ending need to be so lame. I thought at the very list they could have ended it on a fun note for the kids but the ending really sucked for my daughters.\", \"Family/adult film mashed in really well! The trailer barely shows anything about how deep the movie is; I really appreciate that! I'm sure production design will surely get recognition at the Oscars I love that they used so much pink they had to get more. I saw it inRPX with my sister Emily which was quite spectacular except for several audience members that were obnoxious and barely seemed into the movie those people like that are strange.I probably laughed at more parts than most people and was engaged throughout. Greta Gerwig made an important film with plenty of charm for everyone involved.\", \"Like many, I saw the ads and read the hype surrounding this movie. And who would walk away from the perfect summer time movie that features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling? I mean just based on curiosty alone, what would a movie about a child's doll be about? So off to the movies we went. And after the first 2 minutes, I was already having a bad feeling about this one.....and I really wanted to like it. As expected, much of the movie happens in BarbieLand, a perfect little beach front community where everyone cherishes Barbie. Lots of singing and dancing, colorful scenery, character introductions and so forth. You wonder where the story is going and out of the blue comes the theme of death. So at this point, its no longer a kids movie IMO. And the story developes into Barbie's mission to cross in to the real world to save the person who's not happy with their Barbie doll. And by not happy, I mean depressed with thoughts of death. A pretty dark twist. So the mission begins with Ken and Barbie visiting LA. The story becomes a mix of several themes including female enpowerment, corporate greed and a push for a male dominated society. Although I chuckled a couple times, this movie never sucked me into the story to the point where I felt I wasnt in a theater, if you know what I mean. In fact, it felt like every 15 minutes I was hoping the movie was over. Margot and Ryan give outstanding performances, but the novelty of Barbieland quickly wears off, leaving the audience blasted with bubblegum pop music and watching Barbie disolve into an emotional trainwreck as she faces a personal identity chrisis. Of course, this becomes the stories message to tweens, that life's hard, its OK to fail and finding strength to succeed isnt easy, regardless of gender. Its an awkward movie in that it doesnt really fit for kids or adults, unless you ignore the story and just look at the pictures.\", \"I have been a Barbie lover since i was a little girl and when i knew they were going to do a Barbie movie I was really excited and looking forward to watch it, especially after all the hype, the attention and all the marketing and everything, but I ended up being really, really disappointed with the movie. Very boring movie from the beginning till the end.Throughout the whole movie, I just wanted the movie to be already over. That's how bored i was and how much it wss not interesting. I really got bored during the movie. There was really nothing fun or exciting. So yeah it was pretty disappointing.\", \"There is first in every thing.And there's the first on a new thing.Greta Gerwig has never disappointed me. Even when she was at her point with the mumblecore genre. Now she bring her class and weirdness to a new top level.With Barbie Greta make the viewers never distracted but confused, in such a glam and fun colorful wave.Greta has done perfectly the accuracy and portrayal of certain dolls and places in Barbie's fabulous and magic world. Additionally, the pacing and storytelling choices feeling that it may bring directly in your cinemas the wonderful, fun, witty and very magic world that is the one of Barbie.\", 'Barbie movie was very under my expectations.The movie per total was a kitsch... from beggining to the end.I expected a more interesting story, perhaps with some decent lines of comedy.The regisor didn\\'t had a vision, she just hurry up to create a piece of something, just to be there in cinemas to gather money.The regisor just took advantage of the big name and popularity of Barbie toy.Mains actors were blunt. No emotions, superficialityThe morala: Humans have just one ending..\\nWhat we all have to remember from this movie, is that all humans have just one ending... Death. - A curse from our \"Loving Creator\"', 'But was pleasantly surprised. I found it very emotional. Fabulous casting, dancing and soundtrack. My daughters 6 and 8 also loved it. My husband even went along and got a few laughs but ended up at the pub with my youngest because the cinema in general was too loud for her. I can see how it could upset and make people uncomfortable that are after a comedy seen through the eyes of a stereotypical comedy director, but that is what makes this movie so different. Definitely bring some tissues if you have any sort of mother-daughter relationship, both good, bad and in-between. I am so glad I could see a movie like this with my daughters.', \"I thought the first half of the movie was quite humorous, taking the Mickey out of the whole Barbie phenomenon that it is.Great colour and cinematography and I even laughed in some parts. Then something strange happened about half way through: it got all serious and made Ken a baddie and then decided to preach to us about the injustices that women have endured (which I agree to be true, but didn't fit where I thought this movie was going).Not quite sure who this movie was intended for, but I walked out disappointed. The males all ended up being either bad or stupid, or both. Not sure if this is a film that the great Will Ferrell can hold his head up high for as his role served very little purpose.The acting and cinematography saved it.\", \"This is the story of old doll Barbie (since many years ago but presented here as a young beautiful woman). She is suffering a crisis about herself and her existence and wants to go to the real world to have it solved. We see nice images from the real world and the Barbie's world and see several other Barbie doll types all along the movie. This story develops itself by a lot of conflicts mainly because at a certain time her lover Ken betrays her and tries to be the leader of Barbie's world which makes Barbie and her allies to fight him and his followers till the end in several intricate scenes till he is defeated and Barbie becomes a real woman with the help of Ruth, her creator. Not a particularly good movie in terms of story but technically excellent.\", \"I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie . It was weird to me but in a very good way and LOL at the ending , made everybody laugh . Check it out , I say it's worth a view in the theatre.\", 'As a man who has never touched a barbie in my life, I was definitely not the intended audience for this film. However, I absolutely enjoyed it. It\\'s funny, entertaining, and poignant. I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive \"person\\'s\" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it. I think any guy tagging along to see this will enjoy it unless he\\'s a misogynist and/or very insecure in his masculinity.', \"Wasn't sure how good this film was going to be but the trailer suggested something magical and the film fulfilled my vision. Congrats to the director who's also the writer with her husband I believe. To the great production design. To the actors especially Margot Robbie and Ryan gosling who continues to amuse and surprise with his ability to switch characters and add humor and a little bit of fun to his roles. And he gets to sing again. Recommend for all ages really but certainly any kid that's over eight or nine should be able to understand half of what's going on and the parents or friends can explain the rest. Enjoy.\", 'Ruth Handler, the inventor of Barbie,had a vision of a grown-up doll that little girls could love. In Barbie\\'s world, everything is perfect, not messy and unpredictable like in the real world. You can dress her and play with her in whatever fantasy you want . In a long scene, Mattel executives are chasing the now human Barbie to get her \"back in the box\" acknowledging its patriarchal structure. Is designed to keep women second class. It does mention but glosses over its role in pushing Handler out of the company, supposedly for tax\\nviolations. One critic noted that Mattel mentions itself no less than 35 times during the film. That said, there are some hysterically funny bits that will appeal particualrly to those of us over 60 years old.I thought Ryan Gosling was miscast as Ken. But Margot Robbie as Barbie was spot on.', 'I haven\\'t seen a movie so funny, energetic, and overall amazing like this one in a very long time! I had somewhat high expectations, due to the good reviews (and the not good ones) and i love Margot Robbie and her acting, she was under-rated in Babylon. I\\'ll just say, that my expectations were definitely reached! While funny throughout this movie is is fully hilarious at times, even if you think it would be some stupid \"all pink and glitter and rainbows\" flick, you\\'ll definitely laugh (and you\\'ll probably love it!). It\\'s insanely funny and honestly touching in some scenes. It speaks a great message as well! Overall, will definitely watch again!', \"This was a very fun, very engaging premise. I don't know if I'd call it groundbreaking, since it's a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy, but this definitely works. The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.I just wish they kept this a little more light-hearted and a little less preachy. There are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination, and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events. But how many great comedies are there these days? How about, for once, just keeping things light and entertaining? (The patriarchy? Seriously?)Regardless, I think most of the audience loved it, and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the Mom's big speech. It's a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power, and you will probably be glad you went.\", \"Barbie, the movie is great! It stars Margot Robbie as the character Barbie! There's also some so many starring actors/actresses who are also in that movie who they are fictitious!

A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with \"Good Boys\". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn\\'t waste any money.', \"This movie really is what I needed. The casting is perfect, Ryan Gosling as Ken nobody would've think it would be that good. I really had a fun time with a lot of laughs, yes there is a serious undertone in this movie about the diffference between women&men but it's given also in a fun way. America Ferrera is giving a bombing acting like she always does! Margot Robbie is just wauw, she is made for this role, i'm so glad she got the role and not Amy Schumer as previously requested. I would die to see the movie again for the first time, for now I will just wait for it to come on streaming and will stream it again! We are Kenough.\", \"I expected this movie to be more lighthearted and it had heavy themes and material. The first half hour or so was ok and had some funny moments but the second half just wasn't enjoyable to me. The writing was not good story telling and felt more like a number of speeches. I found it hard to watch honestly.There was a lot of overt messaging that I feel was not suitable for this movie. I didn't appreciate the depiction of the relationship between Ken and Barbie or the situation created for them. The acting, some musical numbers and sets were good but overall a missed opportunity to make a fun feel-good movie. I was very disappointed.\", \"The much anticipated Barbie movie. It's unreal to see a packed theatre 3 weeks after release, what a summer for movies.This film was so much fun. I had a perpetual grin on my face the entire two hours, only growing wider with every joke. I'm glad I experienced it in a theatre setting, laughing along with others is a great feeling - and there was plenty of laughs to go around. Genuinely one of the funniest films I've seen in a while, the adult-targeted cultural/societal humour really, really worked. Theres not much to say about the set design, costume dept., hair, makeup, and sets other than its nothing short of awe-inspiring. The production design is pretty much flawless. Also, the movie references and homage payed to classics like 2001 and the Matrix was very, very much appreciated. My only complaint would be the third act of the film. I feel like the fast, satirical humour of the first two acts worked perfectly, challenging and poking fun at cultural, societal and political norms, but doing so in a clever way which serves the story and script - gracefully. The third act throws this creative ingenuity out the window by way of heavy handed, in-your-face monologues.\", \"I must admit, growing up I've had complicated feelings toward Barbie. In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.This movie is exactly what I would want from a Barbie movie. It's extremely campy throughout, but also recognizes that life is very much complicated. It's not easy being an adult woman or man. Do you want to laugh? Watch this movie. Do want to feel seen and have one of those cathartic cries? Then go and watch this movie!\", \"To see a universe that's a Barbie world where the Barbies are the rulers and the Kens are just there to support Barbie brings our universe into focus. Ken doesn't feel loved and respected or important in the Barbie world. He steps into the real world where men are respected and many thing revolves around them and he realizes that he can be more. I hope that this movie could help men feel more empathy towards women and the way this world makes them feel less valuable and important. Women couldn't own property before and in Barbie world Kens didn't have a home to call their own or any important positions.Because women in the real world wear multiple hats, they have to be seen in many ways. They have to do many contradictory things to be liked. Women have to tie themselves in knots to be liked by other people. That's what this show tried to say too.I wish the Barbies realized how they were excluding the Kens and not treating them with respect and made changes to fix that. The world we live in is so male focused that we are so used to it that it seems normal and not unusual. But just like everything being ruled and centered on the women in the Barbie world seems strange, you realize the reverse is strange too.The movie had that message to me but it also was fun and light hearted and went by very quickly. It was enjoyable and entertaining.I guess the very end was not satisfying to me though. It got to weird and pointless at the end.\", 'This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It\\'s amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I\\'m not sure why some have labeled it as \"preachy\" or \"agenda-driven,\" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film\\'s intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie\\'s original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren\\'t the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!', \"Barbie is a story of a Barbie gaining sentience when her owner hits a bad time affecting her life in BarbieLand.

I also really enjoyed the ads threw out movie.I was really enjoying this movie but then it started getting really political, I was kind of fine with it but then they started making politics the whole story line and so it was really no longer a fun movie. After the movie finished I just ended up leaving miserable and like I waisted money... How is a family meant to enjoy this?? I can't see any 13 year old understanding anything they talk about.Also they want to talk about how being a human is hard and that were not perfect but then they hire someone to play a teen girl who has perfect hair and skin. A bit of a confusing message?\", \"First impressions of the movie where mixed. The script is pretty much garbage. It sends a solid message about equality while somehow does the exact opossite.It tries to create a society where men and women are at the same level and all bodies and races have the same value but also does the opposite making sometimes girls look much inferior than men and men inferior than women.The movie is about laughing at how basic, stupid and ignorant the fan base of the movie really is. If you went to the theater wearing all pink and well dressed then you are what I'm talking about.I must say it was a fun movie that made me laugh at some points. It was so fun to see how ignorant the people watching this movie are that made me also laugh and be worried about how the society has fallen. I went to see the movie making a double session after seeing Oppenheimer so that may be why I notice the difference about the audience.If you are a girl and you laughed a bit too much then maybe you should go and search for a psychiatrist because if you like being made fun off then you have some problems.Basically, if you are a guy taking over a girl then you are bad. If you are a girl taking over a guy then it's all good. The movie supports the extreme left, politically btw.At the same time it also teaches guys and girls that they don't need each other and can live by their own. It's a journey about finding yourself and what it means to be a guy or a girl. It tries to take out stereotypes by saying all bodies are perfect but when Barbie gets cellulitis it's then she is ugly and wants go back to be perfect and to the usual stereotypes. Also let's include fat barbie and paralytic barbie but for some reason let's not include fat Ken or paralytic Ken and just make them all gorgeous and fit, clearly not body-shaming guys...If you are wondering why I haven't spoken about any of the plot, well... that's because there isn't one besides vibes and ideologies.I was also surprised in the good way for not having woke characters or members of the lgbtqi+ comunity. If there is a movie for it, it's this one but I'm glad they did not force any of that.It's sad to see that almost all the audience just went there to show off their pink outfits, tell everyone they have watched the movie by taking pics before or after the movie and to stay on their phones instead of watching it. I came out of the movie worried about where society is going and I think that was not supposed to happen.\", \"Making a Barbie movie about feminism is a cool idea. Having Barbie comment on the patriarchy just like Animal Farm about communism and Wall Street about capitalism. It's admirable and the message gets through.The problem is that the actual movie is so bad. Even though you buy in on the two worlds, etc, etc. In the end, it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel. Normally, the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels. Here, everything is spelled out from a a teacher's desk and the whole film comes across as bit thin.I would not watch this movie again.\", 'Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie\\'s world and the satire of the Ken\\'s and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie\\'s speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara\\'s monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society\\'s imperfections. Men who say this film isn\\'t good or \"anti-man\", is part of the problem.', \"Viewers are plunged into the sunny, candy-coated world of Barbieland, where Stereotypical Barbie enjoys her idyllic life, until she's abruptly struck with an existential crisis. With dopey Ken as her companion, Barbie journeys to Real World where, not to put too fine a point on it, things are just irrevocably messed up. Greta Gerwig's glossy, sparkly, splashy, musical satire offers up dazzling visual eye candy, with some double entendres and clever, funny critiques of consumerism, feminism, masculinity, and the hierarchical system. It opens with such flash and snap, until it veers off and stumbles over itself trying to hammer home its message while searching for a real plot, and then reverts into some formulaic battle between the matriarchy and patriarchy with shifting sympathies that actually confuse its themes. Nonetheless, an obsequiously grinning from ear to ear Robbie is ideally cast, but so is daft, superfluous Gosling making it hard to deny. **½\", '\"Come on Barbie let\\'s go party!\"A comedy fun for audiences. Laugh, laugh, cry and laugh again. The first film I\\'ve watched that Greta Gerwig directed and I was impressed on how she was able to pull off a good film.Probably not the typical toy to live action movie set up but it really has the feels of Toy Story (crossover maybe? Kidding). What the film offers is a lot of comedy which movie viewers will likely to enjoy. It pays homage to the different types of Barbie dolls but that depressed and ordinary Barbie were the best in this film. With Barbie, there comes Ken and Alan? But Ken was not sidelined in this film. In fact, I kinda felt more empathy on Ken\\'s side than on Barbie\\'s. Yeah this is a film based on Barbie who of course we know that without Barbie, there won\\'t be a Ken. However, this film shows its viewers that it shouldn\\'t be that way. Ken is as important as Barbie. On the other hand, that speech of \"Gloria\" was really moving and very inspiring.This film takes us to a world where toys and humans interact. Where those who live in a cycle can break the chain and have a decision to make. Where every individual has a choice and every person in this world is as important as the other.Barbie is 7/10. Enjoyable, fun for family however as my friend have said, there were scenes in this film that felt like \"what\\'s next?\" or some parts felt like fillers. Still, it was enjoyable and a good film.On the side note, Greta Gerwig, PLEASE DO WELL ON NARNIA ADAPTATIONS. In the meantime, where to buy that \"I am Kenough\" shirt?', 'Didnt know what to expect going in, but was surprised at how good it was.The films entire premise is to shatter the 4th wall, both with its story and literally, just shattering it whenever it wants. With the message that what you see onscreen is just that, and not an actual representation of reality.This is incredibly well done..for the most part. Great all around acting from the entire cast, lizzo & ice spice will never be talented, in anything, ever, please pipe down.Margot Robbie was an excellent ironic choice, as she is an actual IRL barbie.Will ferrell and the other comedy is quite funny, plus ryan gosling is just one cool guy.Barbie also beat Oppenheimer to the streams, and doesnt go for 3hrs.', \"I went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism, but I found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie. I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.\", \"I can't believe it. Humans have made a good movie. How is this metaphysically possible? Isn't badness defined as the quality uniting things that humans love?Let's start from the beginning to see where I got it wrong. In the beginning, the good God creates the universe. Ialdabaoth then creates humans in his image. Humans then excrete the civilization they love today. But somewhere in the middle of that rancid dumpster fire, there's a good movie created to sell dolls to little girls.This can mean only one thing. We were wrong when we thought intelligence is the solution to our problems. Maybe we should lobotomize the geniuses and start over.\", 'Why?! All this great movie like The Flash without audience and Barbie... with fulll rooms... I started to fight against my sleep since 30 minutes of the movie. I was expecting a lot more of this movie but empty and boring... at least to me and to my friends Wife that gave up at the middle of the movie and she was so anxious to see it! I\\'m wondering if people really enjoyed the movie or only told that that have enjoyed it to please the others... I give a 4 stars rate only to don\\'t be very very bad to the cast that made their best to save this... \"disaster movie\" I don\\'t think I could see it a second time.', 'I saw Barbie yesterday with four women friends. We didn\\'t know what to expect, but we all loved the movie! The writing was amazing. The acting was perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were a great team. The music and dancing was truly entertaining. I actually cared about the characters, all the Barbies, all the Kens, as well as the mother and daughter in the \"real\" world. Will Ferrell was at his peak comedically. I also appreciated the overlay of politics, for those who are so inclined. I plan to see it again.

Loved it, and honestly, I thought I\\'d hate it.', \"I know there's been concern that the movie will be overly feminist because it was written by Greta Grewig. This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.I think the movie would've worked better as a tv series to allow the writers to flesh out the characters a bit more. It would've been better if we understood more of what created the distance between Gloria and her daughter (See? I can't even remember her name). When did Barbie first start feeling that she wanted more than the same existence everyday. Why weren't the Barbies and Kens capable of understanding more than their world? Didn't their characters encompass their human counterparts?Anyway....the movie was fun, lighthearted and something for everyone to enjoy.\", \"As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast. Yes the plot is thin, yes it's a little bare bones and yes there's some minor pacing things here and there. But for what it is I liked this movie a lot. I will be watching again on streaming!\", \"I really wasn't expecting much from this movie when I decided to watch it but I thought at least I would have some laughs right? That did not happen...So incredibly boring and the songs are so cringe and bad. This is supposed to be a comedy? I haven't laughed once. I wanted to quit halfway but I thought once I started it I'll finish it. I don't even know how I managed to get to the end...I don't understand the hype around this movie and the score it has here on IMDb is more laughable than this movie could ever be. It might be amusing for kids around 7-10 years old, but adults: stay away from this one.\", \"I went to see this one with my 11 year old daughter, thinking that it would be a movie directed to kids. It's not! Actually, it's one of the best social satires I have seen and many jokes and references will be difficult or even impossible to understand for kids. They'll still be having a good time, but it's the adults that are actually in for the big treat. I absolutely loved it and recommend this to everyone who loves a clever satire with a lot of heart and mesmerizing cinematography.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfect in their roles, the script/story is engaging, funny but also very touching at times and the overall result is delightful.You'll find yourself wanting to own this one in your collection, it really is that good.\", \"It wasn't bad at all; it's funny and certainly worth watching. Margot Robbie delivers a brilliant performance and perfectly embodies the character, bringing the iconic toy to life.Barbie, as a doll and figure, became immensely popular and essentially replaced the term 'doll' itself. In the past, any such toy was simply referred to as Barbie.The movie explores how these figures became companions to many, more than just toys. It showcases an alternate world of Barbie in a joyful and beautiful manner.It's a good movie with plenty of laughs and overall enjoyment. Simply sit back and enjoy this one.\", \"Barbie was a great film. This movie is so well written and super clever. Makes you laugh, cry, and ponder what it means to live in today's world.This film has a message for us all and makes some excellent philosophical points that will leave you thinking when the credits roll. It's that kind of movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie didn't go the cartoony, campy direction. It so easily could have. But it went a much more thoughtful and clever way than I ever would've anticipated. I predict this movie becoming a classic, totally quotable movie, for years to come. Most of all I enjoyed myself at the movies again.\", \"This film had to be more than advertising Mattel's famous doll, which set the standard for playthings fifty-odd years ago. And getting Greta Gerwig to direct a movie about Barbie, seems to have been a creative masterstroke. As expected, she has delivered a stylish incarnation of the sometimes much-derided doll, and it's a fun movie that carries its serious message quite lightly.It looks spectacular, with Barbieland depicted with so much pink it could be nauseating, but the camera is moved around very skilfully so that images are fleeting. With most of the characters being Ken or Barbie, it is easy to follow, and the audience knows that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are the pair to follow.The plot is simple enough, with Barbie suffering a trauma that causes her to visit the real world where some shattering illusions cause her to rethink her role as a female icon. Robbie is stunning in this role, she has always shone in playing over the top characters, and Barbie has given her plenty of scope for this. She is matched by a superb Ryan Gosling, clearly enjoying playing a downtrodden male who gets a chance to avenge his status, and the rest of the cast are all good as well, particularly America Ferrera as a Mattel employee who sees through the Barbie dream, and Will Ferrell, being the usual Will Ferrell as the boss of Mattel.I really enjoyed the film, but the second part was somewhat overlong. Gerwig also couldn't resist getting into a preachy mode as the ending approached. I docked two stars for that, but otherwise this film was the tonic the film industry needed. There have been too many mediocre films lately, this isn't one of them.\", 'Barbie sets herself to go to the real world to solve her flat feet and cellulite by connecting with the girl that played with her.Entering Barbieland is breathtaking. It\\'s built exactly like a child\\'s imagination with incredible set designs and quirky mechanics. The first thirty minutes are fun and filled with music and bright colours. The dance sequences brings me back to my childhood where I would create these kinds of scenes with my toys. I wish we could have stayed in this wonderland a bit longer before we had to get to the real world.Ryan Gossling stole the show. I don\\'t remember the last time I laughed so much. It was iconic how Gerwig reversed the narrative and made Ken into the typical representation of women in film. The film is so clever and is clearly made by someone that is a student of film. With references of Space Odessey, the Matrix, The Truman Show, The Wizard of Oz, and hundreds of others, it made the film have that much more depth.I feel like the plot could have been rearranged a bit. The quests Barbie is supposed to solve seems irrelevant to me. It offers comic relief, but I believe it would have been more pertinent to have her explore the real world to see how Barbies \"saved\" us. The mom and daughter character are useless to the narrative. Other than having 0 personality or depth, we never got to understand their tension or learn their drives. They could have been better written, or removed all together. The monologue sequence was a mistake. Show me how women live in this world instead of telling me. It sounded too preachy for me, despite me being a feminist. If we would have spent less time on the mother and daughter, and more on giving concrete examples of women\\'s pressure, it would have been a stronger film.The story and characterization is also lacking at Mattel. We never get a conclusion to why Mattel went back to Barbieland. The story felt incomplete, and perhaps overly cut due to corporate producers. This brings me to argue that we didn\\'t receive the movie that was intended by the director. Although it being a critique on our society and the impossible standards for women, it could have been pushed even further. Perhaps the large presence of corporate players like Mattel and Chevrolet hindered the extent of the satire. I was expecting a Kubrick kind of satire, and as much as we did get some of that, more subtle satire could have been beneficial. I have full confidence in Gerwig\\'s skills which is why I\\'d be curious to see a directors cut. Let\\'s petition for it!The ending was also disappointing for me. I felt like I was watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 for no apparent reason. Perhaps they didn\\'t really know where to go with the story and I\\'m shocked they chose that. I liked that we got to meet the creator of Barbie, but there was something missing for me. Overall, this was a fun time. I think most audiences will enjoy this despite having some plot holes. I look forward to watching it again in the future.', 'Watched the movie last week as family since daughter wanted to see it. The marketing engine has been working overtime as there is a lot of hype generated by placing Barbie topic everywhere. The actors did great job in the role and script they have been given, but the movie falls short on delivering experience. The storyline is mediocre at best with gaps in places and the ending is confusing as if the writer hit a brick wall.Mattel is only eyeing profits from movie and metch sales and paying zero attention to actually creating good movie. Comparing this to LEGO which was far better all round.', 'I loved this movie so much. It\\'s so effortlessly funny with the end being heartfelt and quite sad. The soundtrack is amazing including one of my favorite songs by billie eilish \"what was i made for.\" The song is so amazing and finishes off the movie in the best way possible.Barbie took a very unexpected turn of events that did not appear in the trailer (i think this is a good thing) and was full of plot twists that thickened the storyline.It is great for all ages and genders as it has a lot of relatable characters.Overall i think it is a movie to definitely add to your watchlist and go see in your nearest cinema!!', \"This movie was a lot of fun to watch. Everybody focuses on Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who were obviously great), but I think America Ferrera and Will Ferrell also gave solid performances.I think both set design and wardrobe did an amazing job. There were so many fun little details and overall they nailed the mood this movie needed.What I did not like are these cringe songs. I would have left those out entirely. Also, towards the end, there was a part (a dialog), which felt really forced to me. At that point even the cinematography was terrible.We will talk about this movie for years, but most of it will be due to its clever marketing campaign, and Barbenheimer memes. However, it is not something I will re-watch in the near future. I'd even go as far as to say it's a one-time watch.\", \"Barbie is a modern fantasy with lots of metaphors about existentialism & feminism, and how everybody (men & women) should get equal opportunity. The archetypal Barbie & Ken have fulfilling story arcs. As do the main human characters when Barbie World and the Real World collide. That collision is a big part of making this a fantasy.It looks and sounds great. Its messages are fab. It'll annoy the right people. It's a big-budget Gerwig & Baumbach film. I love their films. I loved this. I'll be making at least one more trip to the cinema to see it again, and it'll be an instant buy when available on iTunes.\", 'I Will keep this as spoiler free as possible. When I heard Greta Gerwig was directing the Barbie movie. I was instantly excited to the fear of everyone around me. I would tell them \"Greta Gerwig wouldn\\'t do a superficial Barbie movie it would be more, it would have message.\" To my surprise it was all of that and more! It was funny and clever. It showed the problems with Barbie (the toy) but also the dreams for Barbie for young girls. It was campy in the best way. And America Ferrera\\'s monologue deserved a standing ovation and I even teared up a few times. So please ignore the low dumb reviews and go see the movie and make up your own opinions. At least for me it was delight to be seen and I hope you feel the same.', \"When I first heard about this movie, I didn't want to see it. Then I watched the trailer and my mind was changed instantly. Margot Robbie as Barbie could not have been a better casting choice, Ryan Gosling as Ken was just *chef's kiss*. It's a wonderfully beautiful and talented cast. It's charming, funny, touching, powerful and overall perfect. The soundtrack is fantastic, I've been listening to I'm Just Ken on repeat for days now. The diversity and representation within the cast is beautiful and so exciting to see in a movie as big as this one. Greta Gerwig and everyone who worked on this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park.\", \"Released: 21st July 2023 (UK)Certificate: 12ADirector: Greta GerwigLoved by critics and the average movie goers. Film buffs like my myself will love it or hate it like marmite. Myself I'm gonna put it in my guilty pleasure list of films. I'm so glad Greta Gerwig is becoming recognised as a film director and writer because one of her previous films Lady Bird was outstanding. She is also known for acting in a great horror film Ti West's The House of the Devil and the brilliant Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs.The film was very entertaining with its hidden adult jokes and how glamorous the world of Barbie is to look at. The soundtrack will become very memorable that will eventually linger with you after the film has ended. Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is the perfect choice, but for me I think Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show more for me. Either way I loved them both! I think they both lead the film perfectly. It was great seeing Micheal Cera again after going under the radar for a while. I remember he was becoming a rising up actor in my college years in films like Superbad and Juno. Also it was great seeing Will Ferrell and Kate McKinnon being crazy as ever. I loved the little cameos from John Cena as Mermaid Ken and Rob Brydon as Suger Daddy Ken. Let's not forget Helen Mirren as the sassy narrator. It was really sweet seeing Rhea Perlman again too. She was great in 1996's version of Matilda as the very wacky mother.How fun the film is it does suffer from originality. The idea behind it has been done to death in films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Last Action Hero and Space Jam. Where I said it's like marmite is because there were moments that I felt like it was a bit strong on the political messages and mental health on today's society; if you are looking to watch a film for some escapism where in my opinion that's what the magic of movie experience is all about. Other than that the film is well paced with its decent runtime.\", \"This is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever. The plot is forgettable and a-lot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes. Barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate. The ken's were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them. Also the barbie's had no objection to the ken's instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought. They were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side character's superficial problems to bring them to their senses. These issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly. The movie has some plus points, being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8* ratings. An excruciatingly mind numbing movie with some moments of laughter, wait for this one to release on DVD or streaming platforms.\", 'I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig\\'s outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing \"Barbs\" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma\\'s were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say,\\nthank you.', 'Greta Gerwig\\'s \"Barbie\" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called \"Barbie\" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the \"Real-World\" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn\\'t like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.', 'I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend. They are 11 and they seemed to enjoy it. The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for. This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters.', \"I laughed and cried all the way through this movie as my 80's child heart healed and my midlife heart felt reassured that how I have felt through all these years is has been seen. Greta Gerwig is a genius and I'm sorry for all those who thought this was going to be some plastic-fantastic fun ride and were stuck with the deep existentialism and down with the patriarchy messaging - but this was a masterpiece! My only hope is this movie becomes part of the school curriculum and is studied for years to come. Bravo - you are changing the world Greta! And Margo, Ryan and the cast were absolute perfection!!! 10/10 all day every day!\", 'I definitely enjoyed watching it. It was light hearted and fun. However, I do find the asethetic a bit too bright for the eyes. Ironic. I know. Just personal preference. Music too loud at times too.I do like the message it gets across. It does make me think about the power imbalance of genders and possibly how all genders are oppressed under the patriarchy. It was pretty well done considering how many messages they need to delivers in such a short time. However, I do wish the story was a little bit deeper and that the twists and turns are a little less straight forward. Too much to ask? Maybe.But I like it and feel more empowered after watching.', \"This is brilliant movie.An entertaining, enlightening and empowering movie.Spoiler- it's about life! About Human beings at their best, worst and everywhere in between.The progression of the story is at a perfect timing of influences, exposure and thoughts for Barbie and Ken. The parallels between the professions of the Barbies and reversals - reflects how we've gone from Mary Richards to ... well you know.Greta Gerwig has taken every facet of the human condition and put a pink glow on it.I laughed, I pondered and I cried. I called my sisters and Mother after the movie and said Thank You.\", \"I heard so much about the movie, thanks to all the marketing and the controversy (not sure what it was). ....and finally watched it. It seemed fun at first. Loved the whole production, the set designs and costumes. But the movie dragged in parts, and it just got worst towards the end. I wish they had a solid and fun ending, but they tried to go a different way, which didnt sit well with me. Don't want to really comment about the feminism empowerment, I am all for it but it was too in your face, and this being supposed to be a light and fun movie, ruined the entertainment for me. Being a women, there are of course many issues faced in reality. But this one didn't really nail it.Among the performances Ryan Gosling was really good as Ken. Margot is very likeable in the movie and looks gorgeous. Will Ferrell was fun to watch and I'm glad he was in the movie.Overall a confusing plot, I wouldn't watch it again. The movie was a little less than 2 hrs Why did I felt it longer?\", \"Honestly Barbie turned out to be a pretty good film, the concept was already a good one and the execution was really good. The movie did feel a bit long though, a few scenes that felt dragged out. I like the mother and daughter, they were like the audience's soul within the movie.The quote where mothers stand still to show their daughters how far they've gone/made it was really beautiful, my mother cried during that scene.Ryan Gosling shined a lot during this film and I liked that since he represented men. (In a way) opinion.Overall really super enjoyable movie for all ages. More so for the adults in my opinion, great message for the Barbies and the Kens of our real world.\", \"This movie is like an interesting conversation you strike up with a stranger, touching on all sorts of things but never really going deep into anything. I guess you can see it a trigger to discuss gender roles and existentialism with your friends after watching it. Unlike the Barbies though, most people tend to not form a life outlook after one powertalk.The cast and the art direction are immaculate, with Ryan Gosling shining bright as a scene-stealer.The plot doesn't flow though. The main issue is that the movie lacks balance between contrived and raw storytelling, so the whole endeavour seems clanky at times.\", \"I went into this film opening day for a good laugh not expecting too much from it. When I exited the theatre I was shocked by how good of a film it was. I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more. Overall 10/10, great message, great acting, great movie.\", \"I'm so happy with the casting that I can look past some other issues. It wasn't as nostalgic as I would have wanted it to be but this is definitely a new generations barbie movie. It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring. This movie won't be for everyone for sure but as a long time barbie fan I'm pleased. They left the movie in the perfect place and I don't need more. One and done and I'm ok with it.\", 'For sure would be better rated if there weren\\'t so many insecure men missing the entire point of the movie, or rejecting it because it is not the same old narrative that has favoured only them until now. I don\\'t think is \"too preachy\" as other comments say. Is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day. Even ignoring the message, it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows, had great music, good acting, creativity, good visuals, all in all great movie. I like that it didn\\'t have a typical love story ending, which would have ruined the whole point of the movie. A fresh movie that is needed.', 'I didn\\'t expect to like Barbie as much as I did, but I enjoyed most aspects of it.There\\'s an edge to the humor, the performances are convincing (Robbie and Gosling go all in, and it makes the film so much better), and there\\'s plenty on screen that is both funny and relates to the real world.Beat for beat, the story isn\\'t particularly surprising. You can see where it\\'s headed a mile away. But the way it carves its own path there using its unique premise, the property, and its stylistic blend of modern humor that reflects the real world is particularly well done. Everything comes together well.Though I don\\'t love it as much as most people due to aforementioned predictability and some of the jokes not landing as well as others, it\\'s still a fun time. Oh, and \"I\\'m Just Ken\" is an absolute banger.', \"What can I say? I went into this expecting at least a few laughs. The trailers didn't even show or come close to reveal the heart of the plot. So here it is:\\nEverything is so horrible and wrong for women today, and most men hate women. Now, as a woman watching this movie, I felt as if I was supposedly being told how much my life as sucked, and how much men have stolen from me. Which is not at all the case. I've had the pleasure of working with men who respect me in a good career, and found the movie distastefully disrespectful of everything I've ever accomplished.I had a few laughs, but found the movie lacking a sense of real purpose and direction. It seemed as though it was seeking to inform everyone about this new agenda that women should be in charge of everything. Wow, sounds like sexism to me. I'd prefer equality, which is something that we currently have.\", \"I loved so much about this movie. From the costumes to the sets to the colors to the soundtrack to the excellent comedy. I also really loved the plot and takeaway of the film.With that said, as someone who believes deeply in the message, it was a little bit too preachy. It laid the message on very thick. And I get it; it's an important and very real topic that has a massive amount of cultural relevance. But we have to give the audience some credit that we can get the idea without the repetition.That doesn't detract from what a fun yet emotional movie this is. Ryan and Margot are amazing, as are all the supporting cast members. It's a movie worthy of the massive craze, for sure.\", \"I watched this movie on an IMAX theater in my hometown (Qatif); it's considered a 70MM\\ncinema in our standards.. As everything was vividly pink, that particular experience made my eyes very sore!! Despite that, I can safely\\nsay that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).Is it boring? Mayyyybe but I don't think so.. does it need a 70MM IMAX? The answer is No No and No.. However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more..\\nSimply put, it wins the Oscar for the most ridiculous movie of the year. So, stop the hate and go give it a genius try.\", \"Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.Development of the characters is non existent so they are constantly changing their mood and personality without any explanation.\", \"I only saw this movie for Ryan gosling and I was not disappointed. Bro brought the humor into this movie like he does with every movie that he is in. His performance was impeccable and kenough. To be fair I was a bit high so I was laughing a lot in the theatres and I was with my gf also seeing the movie. And I just love how Ryan aka ken brought the character to life in a special way. And of course the song he made is just absolutely wonderful in everyway. One of his best performances ever highly recommend for kids and for families to go and enjoy themselves. As Ryan gosling would say I'm just Ken and I'm enough.\", '\"Barbie\" is a film that left me with mixed feelings. While it had its strengths, like Ryan Gosling\\'s exceptional performance and emotionally impactful scenes, I found the film to be a bit overloaded with messages. Some parts were polarizing, and the humor occasionally missed the mark.Spoiler alert: The film\\'s message about embracing uncertainty and self-discovery was commendable, but the execution sometimes seemed confusing. The protagonist\\'s journey towards self-acceptance could have led her to a simple job, symbolizing personal growth. Instead, the choice to visit a gynecologist seemed a little too on the nose.One standout aspect was the beautiful message conveyed through Billie\\'s song, which added an exquisite touch to the film. Overall, I\\'d rate \"Barbie\" 7/10 stars for its strong performances and emotional moments, but it could have benefited from a more focused approach to its messages.', 'You\\'ll never going to hate this movie, as soon as possible!!So, I finally watch the new Barbie movie in theatres, but as soon as I watch the movie, I\\'m very shy to see her in real-life at this point. Me and my niece, and my cousin went to the mall to watch this movie. Mario Movie is for kids, but Barbie was not either made for kids though, but it\\'s a live-action movie. I rate this movie a perfect star 10/10.In under a span of a month, it\\'s official. The \"Barbie\" movie will surpass Mario Bros. Which is still standing on top of the box office. So now, I\\'m tired of people saying positive things about \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" and this is why the negative reviewers are getting crapped on because our reviews are our opinion that they don\\'t like.', \"Like I said, this movie is just chef's kiss. It's funny, airy but also has a deep meaning when us women can relate to. I have never felt so understood watching the movie and I hope that men will learn to understand it as well. Honestly the movie brought me to tears, especially the end. The music, cast, script and the acting were perfection.Also the character Alan is so underrated. Alan represents all the men that don't take part of the problem. He stands with Barbie even though all the Ken's stood against her.When I saw this movie I could feel all of us were united. This movie represents us, what it's like being a women and how it feels to be a women.Thank you for showing everyone how this world works.\", \"I genuinely had planned to give the movie a 5 because it wasn't bad but it wasn't good but then the longer I have had to think after the movie I still feel that way but also like the movie was a waste of time and money. I really had hoped it was going to be amazing!! It is Barbie for crying out loud. And while I have never been a huge fan of playing with them, they are iconic. I also felt they cast Ken and Barbie perfectly. However the movie made little sense, their are no really good amazing lines to quote, and the ending was blah. It wasn't very fun or funny either. So I decided it gets a 2 instead of a five.\", \"This movie is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it would be your average formulaic movie, but no. This movie is deep. It explores topics such as feminism & the patriarchy, femininity, existentialism, and a lot more. It uses incredible comedy to make its points, and hence, doesn't come across preachy at all.Greta Gerwig is absolutely incredible, this is 100% her best work so far. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did a splendid job, as did the rest of the supporting characters.Also, the nostalgia you'll feel when you watch this movie is insane. It's so crazy how similar every girl's Barbie play-stories are. I love that I'm just like other girls!!\", 'I like F-Rating movies, to know and understand women, especially the hidden value of feminism around the story scenario, and of course there is no doubt what makes it Grate Gerwig. Although this time, there is no Saoire Ronan in my opinion is the best chemistry between directors and actresses for female films. This work Barbie, comes set in Barbieland\\'s fantasy that depicts the irrational of a woman. The moving plot of the Barbie fantasy world, conflict increases when entering the world of reality, and the ending is resolved according to the maturity of the story, which is a red herring type of plot; what is meant is that the author diverts the audience\\'s minds, as in this film Barbie has to correct flat soles, but it is not the essence of the Basically the director wants to convey the feminine phase, with an amazing fantasy idea, between the difference between the world of reality and the world called Barbieland.I went straight to the point, which was the first time that Barbie, like women in general, felt insecure, she realized that her feet were flat when she stepped on the sand on the beach. This is my favorite scene, because it reminds me of my childhood, when I saw my sister crying because her Barbie doll didn\\'t stand up straight. I got the meaning from that scene, that in real events women often do not suspect their shortcomings in public places, in this film Barbie is a woman\\'s childhood imagination playing with Barbie dolls, thus avoiding damage or defects in a doll. This adds up to Barbie\\'s wish to go to the real world, to repair the soles of her feet, and the plot twist is that there is a childhood human, who has a barbie doll toy in the form of the main character Barbie, played by Margot Robbie. This is as if a woman will try her best to find the best treatment, in order to eliminate physical deficiencies, regardless of the morals contained in her, even though she is Margot Robbie too.The scene between the world of reality and the world of Barbie, in this case my analogy, the world of reality is represented against liberalism, and the world of Barbie is imagined conservatively, this imagination creates matriarchy in the fantasy world of Barbie by feminism, while the opposite of reality, there is control of the world of Barbie by companies acting in a patriarchal manner. Then the scene of an elderly grandmother, namely Ruth, whom Barbie first met, accidentally sat next to Ruth. My intuition at this moment, seeing the happiness of an old woman, whose beauty is faded but full of precious experiences, thinking that beauty can disappear, and that\\'s what Barbie feels when she looks back at Ruth, and also makes Barbie aware of her question about \\'death\\' in the musical scene at the beginning of the film . This is where Barbie\\'s maturity signifies when she returns to Barbieland.So that at the ending point, the message of this film that describes the growth period of a woman, and the slogan \"She\\'s everything. He\\'s just Ken\", I interpret women as creatures that are unpredictable, experience social phenomena that occur, want to try new things until they get their point of freedom, the purpose of life is understanding everything, pride in being a complete woman who is, in expressing herself in a complex environment , especially women who live in a patriarchal environment. Finally, Barbie realized the meaning of girl, mother, grandmother, and chose to act as an independent woman without admiring men, in this case, Ken.Overall, the scenarios that are played are quite fast and do not create unnecessary scenes, the accompaniment of music to pause the audience brings the neatness of cinema that is of theatrical art value, plus sarcasm scripts that contain, in terms of the capture of the ratio of connoisseurs and comedy humor. Regarding production design, without a doubt, maybe I championed this award was obtained by Barbie at the 2024 Oscars, because from that side it really broke marketing, the pink color is like a mandatory costume for anyone who watches. I give Barbie: 7.5/100.', '\"Barbie: So Clever and Colourfully Fantastic!\" is a cinematic masterpiece, gracefully dancing between hilarity and heartfelt emotion. This modern gem captivates with fantastic acting and a vibrant kaleidoscope of colors, embracing the theme of being ordinary and finding one\\'s true self in a world that often celebrates the extraordinary. Refreshingly, it focuses on genuine connections, friendships, and personal growth instead of romance, making it enchanting without clichés. The talented cast delivers outstanding performances, while the visuals and captivating dance sequences create moments of pure cinematic magic. \"Barbie\" strikes the perfect balance between humour and gravitas, making it a touching and relatable exploration of self-discovery. A delightful fusion of \"Elf\" and \"Pinocchio,\" it charms audiences worldwide, transcending age and background. For an uplifting and soulful movie experience, \"Barbie\" is the perfect cinematic gem.', \"Just watched the première of Barbie with my wife, my daughter and my son. I'm pleasantly surprised. Sure, it's a fun movie and Margot Robbie is gorgeous as Barbie (and Ryan Gosling is a perfect Ken). But the movie is, in fact, an interesting commentary on, both, patriarchy (and the negative effects Barbie dolls have had over the years) as well as on mortality. The movie is more profound than I would have thought. I'm also pleasantly surprised by the open-mindedness and humour of Mattel. What is missing is that the movie sometimes lacks intensity and becomes only candy for the eyes.I'm giving 7/10 to Barbie.\", \"Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll. But well wel well, it happened.Anyway, it deserves all the hype. Margot Robbie IS Barbie, there is nobody who could've done the role justice like her.And Ryan? Well, he's just Ken.\", \"I enjoyed this film. I cried at the ending and I laughed out loud at some parts, which is something not many films can actually do to me. I LOVED the visuals - it felt exactly like Barbie should feel to look at, and I love how the film never seems to take itself too seriously, which again, is what I expect from a film about a Barbie doll.Having said that, there were a few things I questioned. I'm not the target audience (being a 17 year old guy), but also... who WAS the target audience? It feels like it should be for kids, but it was far too existential for that, especially at the end, and some of the jokes were just blatantly sexual. Was it for people who used to own Barbies as a kid? It was still enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend it for small children or even children at all, really.I feel like I have to be careful saying this, but the message of the film was a bit over the top. I understand it and I liked that it was there, but it felt a bit crammed down our throats. It almost feels like a caricature of our own world at times. The real world sucks, but the divide between men and women isn't THAT pronounced - not all men are incompetent, macho freaks who have everything handed to them on a silver platter, and not all women are suppressed as intensely as the film seems to suggest. Still, it was a good message and made me emotional at points, and it was still a fun film experience, albeit not what I was expecting.\", 'Such a silly, beautiful, wonderful movie! This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It has heart, soul, and lots of laughs. I\\'ve seen it twice so far and it honestly gets better with each watch. I\\'m looking forward to owning it when it comes out for purchase as well. This will definitely be one I watch a lot. Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken is everything, and he\\'s absolutely perfect. This entire movie is perfect. I don\\'t want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven\\'t seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S. Isn\\'t not \"sexist\" it\\'s making a point, and people that have a problem with what it\\'s saying should probably ask themselves why and look inwards.', \"It was not as light-hearted and fun as I was hoping. I wasn't expecting such a deep message to be told to me by a Barbie. There is a lot of satire in the film, that I feel some will take to be truths.But, costumes and sets were on point! I hope that team gets all the nods for their accomplishments. The soundtrack is lacking, too. Maybe I do not have many nice things about this film, other than it wasn't for me. Instead of it being a cute comedy, I became more depressed by watching the movie! Margot and Gosling played their roles well, and I applaud them. But the other all content, was just too deep, and not fun.\", \"This movie didn't really fit with all the other movies I love like fight club and things like it but I am secretly so connected with it. It really has the power to make me cry and laugh and I just have fun watching it. I truely love Greta and I think she did such an amazing job , so did america , I hope she wins best supporting actress because her monologue was incredible. I have been to watch this movie twice now because I love all the important details. It's so perfected to every last part , the same pink feel to it. It makes you love being a girl and love girlhood. It's a great meaningful movie.\", \"Started well including the scene where Barbie removes her feet from her shoes and remains the same shape (as per the trailer) but after Barbie and the characters were introduced the script began to lose its way. As though the writer tried to include little memories or what would be nice rather than a theme or good story throughout. If you have nothing to do worth watching but if you are expecting laughs or a wow factor don't expect too much. I think also instead of directing to children and adults just stick to one or other. Actors were all good but the story just let them down. Hopefully not a trilogy on the way.\", \"The Barbie movie is a mixture of comedy and an analysis of an old era idea, using scenery that rivals classics like Playtime, and a cast that was clearly hand-picked with stars like Margot Gosling and Farrell. The movie features an astonishing soundtrack, including Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, Billie, and much more. Barbie's presentation is top-notch, and some might even say it couldn't be any better (I would've agreed). However, the writing itself doesn't quite match its other impressive traits. Despite adapting the boring and monotonous toy line into something actually interesting on the big screen, it felt throughout the movie that the ideas of the writers were too disjointed. This led the director to piece together a self-exploration story with a modern world outlook, topped with media manipulation and a critique of society from a male perspective, with a side dish of a womanly critique of society. Safe to say, not every point got across as intended.The plot starts in Barbie Land, where we witness Robbie's character's journey and her existential quest. Concerned for her designated child's fate due to the villainous scholiosis, the tall blonde takes action. The movie's second part shifts to real-life segments, offering hilarious situations with Ken & Barbie. The perfect doll believes she's found her child but faces an unwelcome surprise, realizing the world is the opposite of her magical land; nobody admires loving Barbies, and the Kens are the ones in control. In contrast, the muscular blonde embraces and reshapes his former land into a fratboy utopia. After finding her true partner in the child's mother and returning to Barbie Land, the toy discovers its destruction under a horse-loving, Mojo Dojo Casa House Living, and beer-drinking government. With a pep talk from her former playmate, she learns about womanhood and reclaims her home using girl power.And this, without the inclusion of Matel and the ending. It tries to reach for the stars with the juggling of three major themes, but it has the wings of Icarus, represented by its 2-hour runtime.The main three themes are the search for one's self, the media prying on those who are deeply insecure, and the question of womanhood's position in society. However, not all themes were treated equally. The search for one's self, for example, had a great realization with the protagonist slowly becoming different from the others, becoming weird as the movie put it, and ending with the pursuit of reality, not succumbing to a safe bubble but embracing the truth fully. On the other hand, the theme of womanhood feels somewhat forced in the end, taking away from the main conflict.The movie starts the process of exploring this theme with the conflict between Barbie and the child of her owner, showing that Barbie isn't as glorious as she felt. However, after this, nothing truly develops. The kid joins the journey and sees that Barbie is a woman just like her, which doesn't really correlate with anything before that. To be honest, it feels more like a relatable moment rather than an actual thing, but I guess that is what solves the big Kenland problem. The middle ground gets taken by the character arc of Ken, and his performance steals the show, but the way it's solved pretty much trivializes the issue Ken was facing, making it an unsatisfying ending that boils down to 'Men are big dumb-dumbs' is extremely unfortunate, as it was, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the movie. However, you can't really rival 'I am just Ken' part.Something even more unfortunate was Farrell's character. He's such a good actor, but he was incredibly wasted in this role. I understand that it's a Barbie movie and kids will be there, and making the man in the suit dumb will make hilarious jokes for toddles. However, couldn't they you know, not put Farrell? His role doesn't really scream expertise, and other than that, they aren't even plot-relevant. I feel like if they just cut this part entirely, the movie would have had a lot more to gain. Besides, the movie is PG-13, so they don't really need to consider slapstick comedy (sorry for offending Mr. Bean Fans).In conclusion, the Barbie movie is surprisingly more than Ken-ough. It provides an amazing soundtrack and even better performances. However, it didn't deliver that well in its plot points. I wouldn't say it's a must-see, but you might be missing out if you don't watch it.\", 'It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you\\'re going to criticize this movie for going \"against your political beliefs\" then you don\\'t deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!', 'FIRST OFF LET ME SAY , I couldn\\'t WAIT to see this. Got tickets for myself and friends. We all wore pink. The leads were terrific. The marketing campaign was completely misleading. The first 40 minutes at tops was what we all came to see . Then it became very heavy -handed. It became confusing. MATTEL who was one of the producers of it should feel shame for I think they ruined their good name with how they let themselves be represented. It was PG and right at the beginning when they have the little girls smashing I mean SMASHING their dolls to bits cause now their is Barbie...a couple of little kids in the audience got very upset to see the dolls smashed. THIS IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE. It wasen\"t my kind of movie either. One of my friends said \\'It was about an hour too long.\" Their were these meanings and symbolism tht didnt need to be in this and whatever the writers were trying to get at ...it didn\"t work at least for me.needlessly having Ken sing .......and thats the least of it....referring to the line \"Some of my best friends are jEWISH\"...completly wrong....even though I now know the history of the doll ...just wasen\"t necessary.... I cannot recommend ...I feel i wasted my friends time ....and some of mine...it really hurts your soul when you so look forward to seeing something and it turns out to be ...blech!', \"I heard it was preachy before going to watch it, but still expected it to be a fun, easy watch. I feel like this is being rated higher because people think there's an important message in there but this shouldn't distract anyone from the fact that it's a very, very bad film with a terrible storyline. After a promising start it becomes excruciatingly boring and predictable. The storyline is what you'd expect from a poorly written children's film, but its wrapped in a heavy handed adult theme. Box office smash but it will be forgotten very quickly. Only highlights were Margot Robbie's performance and Michael Cera and Kate Mckinnons small but funny parts.\", 'Male loneliness is directly tied to the high value that we give to romantic relationships, as it tends undervalue any other form of love. It results in a current (and big) social problem: straight men who have zero valuable, deep and intimate relationships with people other than their girlfriends or wives. Men depend on women as a source for happiness through romantic love. That\\'s why many straight men have no identity other than being a boyfriend, a husband, a provider.Ken and Barbie had to enter the real world to realize this, among more important and focal problems related to feminity and the place of women in society (which were precise but I don\\'t write about because, as a cisgender man, I think is more valuable if I talk about masculinity and male problems). They question their identity and Ken realizes he doesn\\'t know himself or his place if he doesn\\'t have Barbie by his side.This is not something that I see discussed much in commercial cinema, so I\\'m glad it was and that\\'s why I focus only in that subject in this review, because it was my favorite message related to the male characters. With the rest of the movie there are many things that could\\'ve been done better, such as the self critique/parody and the meta-irony, but the good elements surpassed the negatives ones in my opinion. It\\'s a fun movie, it\\'s very simple, but you know, sometimes less is more (and I think it\\'s better that way in Barbie).It\\'s not the movie of the year and it\\'s definitely not Gerwig\\'s best or deeper film, but it\\'s worth noticing the biggest commercial flick of the year to be a sort-of gender issues 101 to people who might haven\\'t even question their gendered role in today\\'s society beyond \"men work, women shelter and that\\'s screwed up\". It\\'s as feminist as a Hollywood commercial film can be.My favorite Barbie is Hari Nef\\'s Doctor Barbie.', \"Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs. Yes, the word patriarchy is said like 100 times. It's crazy. This was so heavy handed I don't even get why woman would like it....ithis should be fun, not some political statement. Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell. I'm telling you most people will not like this movie, unless you're far far left.\", \"For one. I really liked it and all the people I know that went to liked it and most of them did get emotional throughout( tears) . But I did show emotions in it but not as prominent , the movie will help people through times that some people have not been through (ie men) but even if you are a man I would still recommend this movie I have no real big complaints but also nothing to right home about that won't give anything away. Other than it's humar and when to use it , the movie knows when to crack a joke and when to move the plot further, I did really like the premise I'm glad how they went for the story and once again i would recommend it to anyone, most complaints that I have heard in person are from people that didn't give it a good try.\", 'This film has hilarious moments and it visually looks good with the set, costume, and prop designs. HOWEVER, the film shoves its agendas down our throats like it\\'s thanksgiving dinner.The marketing team played it off as just a fun, harmless, self-aware comedy but the end result is this cake full of feminism, mockery of the entire male species, outright preachy at times and covered in icing of a colorful fun experience.The movie contrasts Barbieland as female-dominated/controlling with men to the sidelines who just are just there to wave at barbie or something. Likewise, in the real world, men control everything and women are just there to look pretty and clean and stuff. The film shows half the human population (the men) as utterly and irredeemably horrible.And by the end you would assume they would compromise and have equal power and respect and everyone would see the value of men and women being both pretty awesome and that they should work together as a team? Nope! The Kens just wither back to the sidelines to their depressing selves while the Barbies go back to their girl-power or ruling everything without thinking twice about it. It feels like they almost had a good ending, but simply just couldn\\'t help themselves.In front of where me and my friends were sitting was this mom and her two daughters who seemed around 5 and 7 and that poor little girl was squirming in her seat and asking \"Is it almost over?\" multiple times to her mom who was trying to quiet her down during another preachy scene. Do not take your little girls to this one. Truly a wolf in sheep\\'s clothing. Using a kid\\'s toy as a trojan horse for feminist messaging is just ridiculous.', 'I wanted a girly movie with humor, amazing looks, and a feminist plot. A true show for the ladies. And this gave me that and more. So many profound moments, so many funny lines, such good acting, the cinematography was beautiful, the sets were perfect, the outfits were on point. First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads. Loved the light this movie shed.', \"The movie was very good. It had comic moments, impeccable costumes and exceptional acting, as well as necessary political dialogues. However, despite these strengths, the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. It felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution, resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the well-crafted narrative. While the movie has its merits, the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again. However, it is worth recognizing the film's strengths and the thought-provoking discussions it initiated.\", \"Barbie may seem like a kids movie at a glance but its more than that. Even though kids are going to love it (no doubt) this movie is specifically made for adults who used to play with the original Barbies. The Barbies that were shown in the movie being exact same as our own childhood dolls takes you back in the past.Margot Robbie's every single action, either crying and laying down on floor or smiling while kissing, is exactly same as a Barbie doll.America Farrera's monologue deserves multiple nominations. She stole the show. Simu Liu was fantastic in it and actually made me sad for Ryan Gosling's Ken.Ken Song is another masterpiece of this movie but it's not as iconic as Will Ferrel calling himself the 'mother' but the best part about the movie was including and remembering Ruth, the founder of Barbie, and her daughter Barbara.The movie broke the wall in unexpected ways, it's classic comedy direct to audience was one of the many great aspects that I loved.Even though I expected a better ending for Ken and other Barbies the movie ended on a happy note which delighted me.\", \"It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it! And Ryan Gosling... come on, i was expecting so much from him, and he was even better than i tought, so freaking funny and always on point! The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all. I think it's a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well.\", 'The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.', \"I love this film. It's so what we need right now. A bright and happy movie that makes you smile.The way people have embraced it is amazing. People dressing up to go and see it. It's so cleverly done. Margo Robbie is stunning and brilliant as Barbie. Ryan Gosling was the right pick for Ken. He has that cheeky charm and vulnerability down to a tee. He is such a great performer and dancer. If you ever had a Barbie this will bring back memories. It's got it's political undertones and it's trying to get a message across. But it's a film I think will be doing the rounds for a long time with the likes of Mamma Mia.\", \"I have questions: when the kens take over Barbie land, they see the Barbies as just accessories but then when the Barbies just swap places every ken still had a Barbie why would they even care as long as they still have a pretty thing listening? I just feel like that scene was kind of random and odd I guess. I still enjoy the film overall it was very visually appealing. Will ferrells character was just cheap laughs, nothing new for him. He's too childlike to believe he intends any ill will for barbie so it really takes the wind out of the movies sails. Also the parallels between this and don't worry darling and they have the same flaw in my opinion. An unclear driving force of why this is happening now - randomly thinking about death? I would have preferred to have seen her be picked up in the real world and then the reveal that it was gloria and not the daughter could have been a more significant moment and they could have fleshed out Gloria's yearning for girlhood more and why she played with the dolls.\", \"In Barbieland, Stereotypical Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, experiences changes both mentally and physically, much to the surprise of the other Barbies. To find the answers she is looking for, Stereotypical Barbie must venture out into the real world, accompanied by her Ken, played by Ryan Gosling. On the plus side, the production design is striking. Barbieland is visually interesting, managing to feel fake, but lived in at the same time. The actors seem to have fun in the roles they are playing, Ryan Gosling's Ken being a stand out, making the best of the material he has. Margot Robbie also fulfills the role at playing a believable Barbie. Unfortunately, the overall execution of the film was disappointing. Most of the humor didn't land for me, though it did have its moments. Then there is the mixed messaging regarding gender roles. The film clearly states what it is trying to say (not subtle at all), but at the same time, undermines it through poor writing and characterization. Likewise, other attempts for the story to get deep end up falling flat by getting in its own way. While Barbie has its moments, it ends up getting held back by poorly executed ideas. Final verdict: 5/10.\", \"Entering the cinema with the expectation of a colorful and girly adventure, I was surprised to find that this movie delved into deeper societal issues, transcending its supposed joyful facade. It skillfully addressed complex topics within a simple narrative, which captivated me. Despite its innocent appearance, the film was profoundly moving, evoking feelings of sadness, frustration, and anger. Watching it led me to embrace feminism but acknowledge that men also face their own issues. The movie's creator intended to shed light on the intricacies of being a woman, and the portrayal of Ken feeling left out highlights one of the many challenges women encounter daily in the real world. It made me realize how our society has always been so misogynistically setup.\", 'Was thrilled at start. What with all the pinks and blues and wow the reference to \" Planet of the Apes\" and \"Thus spake Zarathustra\". Somehow Greta or the writer did not know how to proceed after the Ken takeover and ended it all with almost a Christian sermon, however feminist it may sound and gave an American ending of all\\'s well. Had expected more.The actors were great. And after the overall hype of Barbieheimer, and of course having seen the Heimer part of it before it was insufficient for me to give a better score. Don\\'t get me wrong it\\'s good if you want to have a good laugh and not really go out with something to chew on.', \"No movie I've seen lately has made me feel this happy. I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an ordinary romantic comedy, but as I watched the movie I started to think about what popular culture has done to people. The costumes are exquisite. The location designs are incredible. Makeup and jewelry design is perfect. And the acting is so natural that it draws you into the movie. A movie for the summer months. You feel incredibly happy when you leave the movie and go home. You are in a fairy tale world but you are facing the harshest realities of the world. I thank everyone who contributed. I hope that the interest in the movie will not lead to a repeat of the mistakes that have been made many times before and a second Barbie movie will not be made.\", \"When you have a cast as big as this film the space for error is low, and although the movie is lots of fun there are still some nitpicks. Lots of the jokes don't land but the ones that do really make you laugh. Margot Robbie gives a great performance and is going to be remembered as barbie for ever. Will Ferrell is very under utilised for such an iconic actor. There's some emotional stuff at the end and that didn't really resonate with me that much, but it might be different for other people. But the best part of this film is Ryan Gosling as Ken let alone all the Kens are great, the musical number and fight they have at the end is the absolute best part of the movie.\", \"The 1968 picture Planet of the Apes reverses traditional roles. After time-travelling thousands of years into the future, astronaut Charlton Heston discovers a world where apes are the advanced primate, and humans their chattels.I hated the movie as a boy, in as good a way as it is possible to hate a film. Could it happen, I wondered, where humans could become inferior to another species? If it did, would we deserve it? The film haunted me enough at age 13 to ensure I have never dared rewatch it.The 2023 movie Barbie looks nothing like Planet of the Apes. Its cinematography is an exercise in high-octane kitsch, as unapologetically saccharine and unrealistic as the dolls it is designed to sell. Yet it too explores role reversal, here between sexes rather than species.Barbieland is a quasi-mirror image of Realworld, the film's moniker for present-day California. Barbieland is a gynocracy and a matriarchy. The Barbies, for they are multiple, live happy, fulfilled lives. They prosper at the top of every profession and public office. They never age, bodily imperfections are impossible, and life is a perpetual merry-go-round of choreographed parties, infinite outfit changes and enduring sisterhood. The men - the Kens - are decoration. They are unable to perform even basic functions: physical and sexual. They lack genitals. Their muscles are impressive but purely for show. They preen on the beach, but surfing is beyond them.One day, Classic Barbie (Margot Robbie) awakens to discover her pristine feet no longer arch perfectly into her high-heeled shoes. She no longer walks on immaculately pedicured tiptoes, but on flat, ordinary, soles, to the collective horror of her sisterhood.Robbie realises something is wrong, and - following a revelation from her compatriot Weird Barbie - sets out to Realworld to resolve it. Classic Ken (Ryan Gosling) stows away in her car. The duo eventually arrive in Santa Monica via a series of rose-tinted vehicles.It isn't long before Gosling discovers that Realworld is unlike Barbieworld. Here, the power is held by men. Gosling, surprised to be treated with respect, becomes fascinated with patriarchy, and quickly warms to the paradigm. For Robbie, the experience is the opposite. People mock her. Daily life is threatening, not fun. Her self-confidence warps into self-consciousness. Ken precedes her return to Barbieland, and quickly sets about transforming the pink paradise into Kendom, a toyish grotesque of Realworld, where the Kens are in charge, and the Barbies retained as ornamental servants.Much ensues. We race and chase SUVs with the mother-and-daughter pair who own Robbie's doll in Realworld. There's an overlong musical sequence, in which Gosling reprises his singing and dancing shift in La La Land. Mattel's all-male c-suite, led by the one-dimensional Will Ferrell, provide limited laughs, and add little to the plot, beyond an admirable modicum of self-awareness. Products are placed - even Chanel! - with abandon. Still, we are being entertained and, mostly, engaged.The final act sees Barbie and friends manipulate the Kens and prevail. There are no suffragers in Barbieland and, following a unanimous referendum of an all-female electorate, the natural order of things is restored. A dark, compelling, twist looks imminent, but it never arrives.Rather than lean into the exquisite role reversal narrative, director Greta Gerwig retreats from it. Instead of pressing her male audience to consider how they would like it if what patriarchal societies do to women was done to them, her finale ploughs a much shallower furrow into well-trodden ideas about the link between mortality and existentialism: 'I die, therefore I am.'Robbie's Barbie eventually opts not to live in Barbieworld, but as a real, imperfect woman in Los Angeles. This is not apparently because she hates what counterrevolutionary Barbieworld might itself become, but because she likes the idea of being human. How do the remaining Barbies perceive their homeland? Do they support gynocracy? Are they comfortable with the Kens being sidelined? The passive ambiguity here is uncharacteristic of a screenplay that, for the first 85 minutes, hammers home its message relentlessly and precisely.The narrator (Helen Mirren) assures us that one day the Kens might enjoy the same status in Barbieworld that women do in Realworld. It is hard to see even that unambitious prospectus being realised, given the Kens are gainlessly employed, politically disenfranchised and allowed to hold only junior roles in the judiciary. Barbie and Ken experience equality in neither Barbieworld nor Realworld: in both realms one sex is always subservient to the other. Perhaps Barbie ultimately prefers LA because, despite its manifold flaws, it at least has no pretence to being a utopia.In Planet of the Apes, we discover, in the final reel, that Heston's destination is not a dystopian otherworld, but Earth itself. Through nuclear war, man's hatred, greed, and hubris has caused his own downfall. The oppressor has become the oppressed; perhaps man deserves it? In Barbie, Gerwig avoids such a subversive conclusion. Instead, she ends with the weakest element of a thoughtful movie: a syrupy anticlimax more predictable of Hollywood, and Mattel.\", \"The only good things about this movie were the actors. Felt like I was watching one big commercial for Barbie constantly plugging outfits and what Barbie really means for young girls, I guess it was produced by Mattel which says a lot.I was hoping for something smart and satirical like the Lego Movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humour.The nostalgia is the draw card for people (including me) I loved Barbie growing up but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy this.Dont waste your time, the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together.\", \"A fantastic fun summer movie! Barbie is not at all\\nWhat I thought it would be. We laughed through the entire movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely perfect as well as America Ferrera. Ryan Gosling plays ken so well with a great twist. The movie had a lot of laughs along with an amazing message. It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see. I went into the movie with no expectations and came out thrilled and wanting to see it again. I've seen a lot of film this summer and this was my favorite so far!\", \"First of all, let me say that my score for this movie is 6.5, but thanks to the site, I cannot give this vote.I agree that this movie conveys a good message and concept, but I seriously don't know why it sold so much, but am I sad? Not at all. It makes me very happy that the movie was able to sell so much after Marvel's superhero movies.all actors have fully understood the concept of the film and good enough. I did not see this movie in the cinema, but I am happy that it made many people go to the cinema and see this movie. In the end, in this time with this movie everything is for the benefit of cinema.\", 'First, I can\\'t believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, \"How did this movie ever get made?\" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it\\'s just sad. I\\'ll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can\\'t believe this film has good reviews. It must me a new way to market films - pay a whole bunch of people to talk it up and write good reviews on social media, and then you\\'ll get the crowds on opening weekend. You\\'ve been warned.', \"I didn't know how many points to give it but I give it a 10 because I have no negatives, I went to watch this movie at the premiere and it was great. The actors did a great job wow! The outfits were also on point. And the easter eggs to Barbies that they were no longer allowed to make was also fun. And the Barbies in the real world was kinda fun how they did was really well done.

And the Barbies in the real world was kinda fun how they did was really well done.\", \"Barbie is basically exactly what we need right now. A hilarious summer blockbuster with a social commentary nuanced enough to allow young ones to enjoy but present enough for you to get something out of it. Margot Robbie is brilliant and a perfect Barbie. Gosling shows off his incredible comedic talent more than ever.Most all the jokes land well. It's clear that the actors understood Gerwig's vision and Gerwig and Baumbach's script. Set and costume design are on another level in Barbie. The distinction between Barbieland and the real world is done very well thanks to set design.See Barbie!\", \"Unlike most movies that come out,\\nBarbie is a fun adaptation and an excellent movie.There is no serious tension in the movie, nor does it have a thrilling storyline but it's just a goofy movie and that's why it can't be compared to normal movies.It's sort of like Tom and Jerry the movie that came out a few years ago, the first live action adaptation. There aren't many movies like it.The acting is phenomenal to play the stereotypical characters from the barbie universe and the jokes are brutally honest and also funny.This movie takes a turn from the regular sci-fi movies that come out on a daily basis and is a recommended watch for family time as well as people looking for something aside from the norm.\", \"Was just okay. The acting is super, ryan makes a super funny and suave ken i think. And margot is a perfect barbie, she ate her role up. !this is not a kids movie! Has many innapropriate things and comments i was not expecting. Most of the humour lands for me honestly, i thought it was cute. The diolouge isn't best but it's a movie about barbie what were any of us really expecting.It was kinda confusing towards the end. The begininng was really fun- maybe a little bit annoying but that's just me, like i said, not my type of film. The colors were great, the barbieland set was cute. After they got back from the real world it kinda fell apart for me. I thought they were gonna go a wholeeeee different route than the ken patriarchy taking over? Then the barbies make them fight eachother and make up? And everythings fine? They tried to make it deep and meaningful but it flatlined along the way. It seems like the whole build up was leading to the monolouge scene. I feel the feminist point of the film would've come across better if it was introduced over time instead of having a few blatent comments here and there and then BOOM big monolouge. It was just a lot, but empty at the same time.And i get what they were trying to do in the real world with having barbie be constantly catcalled but that also got to be a lot i think. Like, point proven, all women have had that happen to them. It was a bit overdone and got a little uncomfy.And nothing was ever really resolved in the real world? Besides the mom and daughter with barbie. And then at the end you think barbies getting a job at mattel, first female ceo, feminism, but no she's just going to the gynocologist. Yeah it was a funny and unexpected moment but they had a chance to do something and they didn't take it.Overall much different than expected. This dealt with more serious subjects and got way deeper into patriarchal ideas than i was prepared for. Thought it was going to be lighthearted!So, idk. It was cute- i may be too hard on it cause i enjoy movies that make you think and have deeper elements. All the elements here were blatently there. Also i'm saying all this as a young adult female- i know i was one of the target audiences for this.\", 'Firstly I\\'ll say that I\\'m the movie\\'s target audience: a female in her 20s. Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won\\'t give spoilers but in this \"perfect\" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances. Some scenes were also very funny but personally I did not like the ending.', 'I couldnt wait for this to come out and when it did i saw it on the day of the release and ohh my everyone clapped and cheered at the end and in the uk no one ever does that but anyway i went with boys and girls and all of them enjoyed it i think truly it puts a message forward which might sound cringe but i dont care but everything about it was so good the acting was phenomenal the casting was amazing the cinematography the music just so good oh my god ive seen it a couple of times now and each time i finished the movie i was so happy for the rest of the day i was dancing and skipping around anyway i love this movie a lot.', \"Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.\", \"Greta Gerwig has had a hit or miss career. Her film Little Women was fairly entertaining, but I found her film Lady Bird to be completely obnoxious. Same goes for Margot Robbie. I enjoyed her in Wolf Of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, but really disliked I Tonya and Birds of Prey.Now comes Barbie, based on the long running series of dolls from Mattel. Now as a guy, I never played with Barbies prefering to play video games over dolls, however my sisters enjoyed playing them and that's the question about this film. Who is the target audience for this film? Because on one hand it looked like a film designed for sixty year old women who never got over playing with their dolls and on another hand, its advertising is aimed at little girls even though some of the material maybe offensive to a lot of families.The plotline, which is extremely thin, involves Barbie living the perfect life in Barbieland where Barbie dolls of all types live and where all the Kens hang out at the beach, Then all of a sudden Barbie escapes to the real world where she is treated like a dog really hammering home Greta Gerwig's misandry.I can see this film having a decent opening weekend but expect it to drop like a rock in the following weeks when people realize this film is really just a one trick pony. The pink sets look nice but the screenplay and the annoying script are definitely going to divide audiences and this film really doens't have mainstream appeal at all. Most of all Will Farrel as the CEO of Mattel is about as annoying as ever and the misanderyt stereotypes are about entertaining as watching paint dry.A one on a scale of 1-10. Save yourself the headache and see the much better Oppenheimer instead!\", 'As of today\\'s date, I would say this is the film produced by Luckychap Entertainment that I\\'ve liked the least, despite a more than promising trailer. Despite a perfect cast (Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling seem to be born to play these roles, and the adorable America Ferrera & Emma Mackey are always a delight to have on screen) + sets & atmosphere that exceeded my expectations, I wasn\\'t convinced by the storytelling at the end. The first half of the film is great, but things get complicated when Barbie & Ken leave Barbieland, and here we fall into the trap of a war of the sexes, when I think it would have been more appropriate to try and raise awareness of the fact that \"domination\" never serves anyone. In short, the film is worth seeing, but I have to admit that given my expectations of it, I\\'m a little disappointed, even if the costumes/settings/acting are stunning.', \"The film has Margot Robbie and she's wonderful. Ryan Gossling is good but has been overhyped in this role. Will Farrell is doing his usual shtick, which is funny. However, the film seemed longer than Oppenheimer ( which is brilliant filmmaking). After twenty minutes I turned to a friend and asked if Barbie had a plot. Five minutes later a story did start to surface, but it was predicable and not terribly involving. Full disclosure: I never played with Barbie or destroyed a Barbie, so clearly I am not the intended audience. Still, there are some very clever bits, the design is super, the last line is a really laugh out loud surprise, and Robbie is a delight in anything.\", 'When I watched the trailer for the first time, I wasn\\'t sure if I would want to watch the movie, but all the great marketing and internet hype made me excited so I watched it, and I couldn\\'t be happier! I have to say that at least every girl should watch this movie!!!The representation of girls \"in a man\\'s world\" and the difference between a fantasy and the reality are shown greatly, but apart from that, the movie and the script just carry such a powerful message towards women that should be heard. When I went out of the cinema, I felt so empowered and self-confident!Kudos to Greta Gerwig and her entire team for creating such a vital movie for women.Another important fact is that the actors and actresses absolutely nailed it!!! Margot Robbie played her role so well, I was actually convinced she was Barbie, and Ryan Gosling had the absolute best facial expressions. I enjoyed watching them sooo much. Worthy to mention is also the awesome work of the other actors and actresses: THEY WERE ALL AMAZING!!! Whoever did the casting for this movie should get a raise. Everybody managed to portray their characters so well!!!One of my favorite scenes was the fight between the Kens because of how realistic the actors played it!And the costumes and decorations/houses should also be acknowledged. I watched the Dreamhouse Tour on YouTube and I appreciated all the detail so much! Barbie\\'s cowboy costume was the banger, I think that was my favourite fit from the entire movie.And the music!!! \"I\\'m just Ken\" is still stuck in my head, and whenever it comes on shuffle, I scream to it dramatically. :) But it\\'s not only this song, I keep listening to the Barbie Album on Spotify because all the songs are so catchy!!!I really want to rewatch this movie!!! It\\'s a solid 10/10 from me. :) (I\\'m a girl, btw, if you couldn\\'t tell xD.)', \"So, I just wanna say that I was very hyped for this movie. But after I watched this, I was a bit disappointed.The movie has a lot of cringe scenes. One of them are funny too, but at some point this is just cringe and too much.About the message of this movie, I agree with it and i like it because in our world women are really disrespected, harassed and so on, but at some point it was too much. I say this as a male, but one of my friends, who is a girl, has the same opinion. But the other one, with the mom and the teenager rebonding, that was amazing.The sound tracks are really good tho. To include artists like Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish and so on is a great move to make this film an iconic one.The cast is great and I think Margot Robbie played Barbie perfectly with her acting and her appearance too.In conclusion, I recommend this movie because I think this is a film that anyone has to watch because it's a Barbie one, and it can also teach teenagers a lesson, despite the cringe scenes.\", \"This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.The movie gets upset at the real world because women don't choose to take on more physical or stressful jobs, and then says that the reason they don't take these jobs is because of men, Men are this men are that, men publicly grope women, every single one, and every woman is perfect no matter how obese or weird they are. It's a waste of time for anyone not watching the movie Ironically, go watch Oppenheimer instead.\", \"In this film I loved I really like costumes and I really the main them on the film it was very good I thought that film will be for kids and children but it literally isn't it is for adults more than a child Margot Robbie is the perfect actress for the main Barbie but main ken could be a different actor Ryan gosling is ver handsome but he is too old for the main ken role I love the main message of the movie I love Emma in education series but she showed us she can be play in other type of roles and I like the pink theme it's very sweet and cute and last thank you all persons who worked in this film.\", \"This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it.\", 'Clever, funny, charming with bright bold colors and visually stunning. But that is what I heard going into the film and I was not disappointed in any way in that area. The sets are also amazing and the Barbie worlds they created vs. The fake real world sets that they made; really cool.The only part that got old fast was the preachiness of the writing. I got it the first 50 times you made it clear about feminism and that women should run everything and be everything. That is fine, but any filmmaker that keeps repeating their point or theme too much risks boring the audience by overstating or over playing your message. Many mainstream & indies have made this mistake. Really likeable cast and set designs, even the music was funny & clever; so a lot of good overall.', \"Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.Barbie 2023 is a delightful and refreshing film that celebrates Barbie as a cultural icon and a role model for girls and women of all ages. It is incredibly funny and smart, with a terrific ensemble cast that all go for it in the best ways. It is also a clever and creative film that explores various themes and issues that are relevant and relatable to today's society. It is a film that can appeal to a wide range of audiences, from fans of Barbie to fans of comedy to fans of cinema. It is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen. Give Gosling the Oscar AND the Grammy!\", \"I was thinking that Barbie was going to be a light hearted family movie.....it is not. You don't want to take the kids to this movie. I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype. I just don't understand why they can't seem to make enjoyable movies that transport you away anymore.\", \"Haters can hate all they want. It's a brilliant movie. I could not have asked for anything more. In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in. And Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were AMAZING as Barbie and Ken.\", \"Barbie represents opression of women all around the world ruled by men. Ken represents manhood without capitalism or without a genital... blah blah blah...This movie should not have been a political satire. It should have been a fantasy romance comedy musical such as Entangled or Disney movies. I left the movie theater after its first 30 minutes so if this one didn't turn out to be a masterpiece in the remaining 1:30 hour of its runtime I had much more funtime wandering under hot sun than watching Barbie...Robbie and Gosling are as good as they could get with this absurd writing and directing.My rating is 3/10 only for the sake of its starting level production staff, PA, Gathering servants who worked for minumum union wage.\", \"Greta Gerwig's style is jumping through the screen. The cinematography and set designs are brilliant here, as Barbie goes from Barbie World to the real world. Gotta say, it's particularly touching. I didn't expect to get emotional but the movie got me one or two times. Margot Robbie is a star as always, and her acting absolutely delivers, showing the inner conflicts of the character, all in nuance and sincerity.This film is definitely not for kids, as it focuses on problems and dilemmas adults have to deal with. The writing isn't perfect by any means, but overall Barbie is a pretty fun adventure.\", 'While I was able to enjoy the Barie movie for it\\'s sarcasm and sardonic, dark humor, it is subject matter way too mature for children. After the movie was over, I heard mostly pre teen girls disappointed there wasn\\'t very much Barbie in the movie. So just a warning to parents, please heed the the PG-13 warning.I loved the clothes, shoes and accessories in this movie! As for me personally, Ryan Goslings Ken was as good as it was possible. Ken in any other world would be a \"10\"! Love that song! It was cute and very silly and super adorable! Obviously, Ryan Goslings is too old for Ken, so he did the best he could. Would I see it again? Not really. As a little girl I used to wonder what would happen if Barbie and Midge became real? I stopped playing with them, and learned to kiss boys. Real life came crashing in. I still keep those memories of Barbie. They are still sweet.', \"This movie is not only lighthearted but a way of exploring how women are seen within society. To Barbie she views herself as someone that strives to be able to do anything a man could do and to her she thought that mirrored to the real world. The movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual. To me, the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and I felt it had such a deep message to be proud that I am a woman. It also referenced how just because toy Ken is an accessory to Barbie that doesn't have to be his only personality trait which I believed showed a great way of presenting the film was not only about women's explorations and feelings but men's as well.\", \"At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.\", \"Barbie comes to life and is surprised by all the possibilities after a life pre-determined. She goes on an adventure in the real world with new friend Madeline. The film celebrates finding oneself and believing in one's potential, with Barbie learning there is no single path laid out and she has the power to write her own story. The film takes Barbie out of her traditional Dreamhouse setting and puts her in the real world for the first time. This allows her to experience what life has to offer beyond what she was perhaps accustomed to. Visually the film looks colorful and upbeat with a focus on Barbie's journey of self-discovery in a real world setting she's unfamiliar with.\", 'I\\'m only saying it could have been better because of the hype. I was expecting a little more and was a little disappointed by some aspects of the film. Firstly I\\'ll say that Margot as Barbie and Ryan as Ken were great individually. A large part of why this movie was so good is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen. I found watching Ken discovering \"patriarchy\" to be the most hilarious part of the film. However, one of the first critiques I have is that it felt like the movie didn\\'t spend enough time in Barbieland. The serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the \"perfect\" life a little more and the character dynamics of the barbies and Kens. This also would have made me personally feel more like I care as a viewer regarding the emotions and thoughts that Barbie and Ken were experiencing when they went to the real world. Secondly, it\\'s use of heavily weighted political words being used loosely by the barbies and kens water down the overall issue this film is trying to be about. I think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed. Or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate. I understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone, and it was. However, it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used. It just felt, in my personal opinion, to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message. Finally, which brings me to my third critique, is that the movie didn\\'t seem to be for kids but at the same time it was? My first argument for why perhaps the two critiques I have made might not be valid is because it\\'s a kids film, and in that sense it would, well, make sense. But then there was the use of heavy political language used throughout the movie that just wouldn\\'t be useful for a storyline in which kids can get the message, not to mention literal sexual reference made to female and male gentilia which seemed inappropriate for children. Don\\'t get me wrong, I love when kids movies throw in a little something subtle for adults to obviously get a giggle at, which I argue Shrek did very well for example. However, the script of this movie (I\\'m not speaking of visuals for obvious reasons) just seemed a little confused in which age group it was catering too. Which arguably limited itself in diving deeper into the above two points I made.Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film and good in its own merits. Ken as a character made a lot of sense given his whole purpose as a doll in real life. And that essence I think they captured well. 7/10.', \"Started well, had some great moments and acting was good.However, the point of turning Kenland back to Barbieland...what was supposed to convey? That Barbies aka women actually want to live looking like Barbies in their almost identical Barbiehouses? That it's women against men and men their dreams are stupid?I found the Mattel team going to Barbieland totally out of context and it didn't add anything either to idea or humor of the movie. Men leading the patriarchy in real world were made to look silly and idiotic, which didn't add anything to the ideas, but felt embarrassing rather than funny.I found the movie weird, confusing and not empowering at all.\", \"I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy. It's worth it, it really really is. Bravo!!!!!!!\", 'I went in there with O expectations, but boy, it was cunning and audacious to say the least! It is one the most original movie made in terms of writing, filming, cinematography, in recent times to be made with a fake subject but very relevant plot!Barbie speaks to alot of women and\\nMEN about feminism, patriarchy, consumerism and existentialism in its own weird, sometimes cringe but mostly funny way.Full Marks for Casting. Top to toe perfect casting for Barbie and Ken. But movié is boring in the beginning and too preachy otherwise.Totally skippable in the theatres. Its not worth the hype tbh.', \"It was one of the worst movies I've seen. I just tolerated it because I was with my family otherwise would leave the theater. Jokes were not funny. The message were poorly articulated. Nothing exciting except the decorations. It significantly lacks depth and can perpetuate certain stereotypes or unrealistic beauty standards. However, opinions on the movies vary, and some viewers enjoy them for their entertainment value and positive messages. It ultimately depends on personal preferences and perspectives. To me it was not funny, nor entertaining. It is a waste of time. No wonder many watchers left.\", \"I was amongst the people who thought they saw a majority of this film based on all of the filming stills posted on the bird app in 2022. I still wanted to see it. Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule. Sorry, Ken.\", 'First half was very enjoyable, but the rest felt rushed and with no direction. Like it didn\\'t really know what to focus on.I loved the music and choreography, the scenography was amazing and I genuinely laughed a couple times.Ken bringing patriarchy to Barbieland and screwing things up is a fun and interesting concept. Although, I feel like the plot turned simplistic and took the easy way out. I don\\'t buy the \"Nah, everything was perfect before, let\\'s get things exactly as they were\".The dialogues sometimes want to be this emotional speeches that kinda take me out, it doesn\\'t feel like a natural progression. As it is often said, it was too much \"tell\" and too little \"show\".', \"I absolutely loved it. Margot Robbie is the perfect stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives an Oscar-worthy performance and has a true rock 'n' roll voice. The soundtrack is also very, very good. Subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references. Michael Cera is funnily adorable. Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion. Barbie was brilliantly cast. I loved Ryan Gosling. He's terrific as Ken and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. The ending is good and it's worth sticking around to watch the credits.\", \"Very good movie Ryan acting is very nice also Margarot . I haven't totally watched this movie but anyway it's good upto I saw this.greta gerwig movies always good movies this film is also not exceptional from that she maintained her touch.coming to talk about screenplay gerwig and her husband Noah their combo both are legendary directors their combo is good not only his personal life but also in silver screen.ryan gosling is rarely do these type characters most of his movies he delivers same expression, thinking about his acting I am not fan for him but I like Margarot I am a big fan for her role Harley Quinn.\", \"Barbie opens with an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey before quickly transitioning to the visually stunning, artificial reality of Barbieland, where the sky is a painting and the food imagined. It's colorful, the set designers display fully realized artistic visions-it's nice to see a movie that isn't over sanitized for a mass audience, a movie that doesn't play it safe. You can see the influences Greta Gerwig wanted to include from old Hollywood all over the place. Margot Robbie is the star as Barbie, fully embodying the perfect Barbie life until cracks start to form in Barbieland.Barbie presents two dystopian worlds, one a bad version of the real world, and Barbieland, where men are pushed aside and given nothing to do at all. Ken discovers the idea of the patriarchy after being respected for the first time in his life in the real world because he never had any power. It was a desperate attempt to gain equality from a member of the oppressed class. Ken is essential to the emotional core of the film. He's how we see the injustice of Barbieland. The movie isn't man-hating, it uses the poor treatment of the Kens by the Barbies to say how dumb discrimination is and that we should all treat each other as individuals, capable of working within our individual talents and skills and that we should be authentic to who we are.** Significant spoilers after this point**The movie also tells us through a memorable monologue from Gloria (thanks to America Ferrera's excellent performance) that we don't have to be perfect, we can embrace being ordinary. She doesn't want the perfect Barbie life either, she wants an ordinary Barbie that's also a mom, loves her family, and embraces her imperfections as good things. The concern with insecurity caused by Barbie is made less tactfully by Gloria's daughter who goes on a screed calling Barbie a fascist (you can't tell me this was intended to be self serious and not a way to poke fun at Gen Z self righteousness).Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie also learns these values, shown when she is sitting at the bus stop in the real world and looks over at the older woman next to her and tells her she is beautiful. Barbie sees beyond the plastic perfection of Barbieland. This is why it's so important she leaves Barbieland at the end of the film, she rejects the reimposed female domination of Barbieland and the point of the film is to say the real world is better than what women may imagine happens in Barbieland. Barbieland is not the good place.There were some significant negatives for me though. I thought the movie had some humor that fell very flat in parts. The scenes at Mattel didn't do much for me. The movie was at its weakest in the real world (where we spent a lot of time). Some of the characters had rushed development.I am Kenough.\", 'I went to see this knowing nothing and exspecting nothing. I was confused with the reference to 1001 Space Odyssey at the beginning but was thrilled with our introduction to the Barbie World. It was a feast for the eyes and a blast from the past. It brought back my childhood make believe adventures with the dolls. Margot Robbie was perfect casting for Barbie. She believably naive without being stupid. I was laughing out loud. I was thrilled with the music and dance numbers. Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken was also adorable. It\\'s when they enter \"the real world\" that things go terribly wrong. Every character outside Barbieland is portrayed in a juvenile manner that made it hard to watch. Then the story just fell apart. It reminded me of a bad SNL sketch where the writers had a great idea but didn\\'t know how to land the punch line or end the skit. I really felt that having the Barbies manipulate the men into going to war to regain control of Barbieland reeked of misogyny. If this had been a play I would have walked out at intermission. I\\'m really shocked that Mattel let their named be used. If this movie had just stayed in Barbieland and explored more of how the dolls \"live\" I would have given this a 10.', 'The real power of cinema came to the forefront as two films went head to head against one another this Friday. One was based on a childhood icon that attained the status of a cultural phenomenon over the years as evident from the massive craze around it and the other was based on an icon in the realm of science whose invention changed the course of the world and was directed by a man who has emerged as a phenomena himself in the world of cinema. The former celebrates girl power and inclusivity while the latter is largely a man\\'s world built on a critique of warfare and corrupt politics. To address the elephant in the room, \"Oppenheimer\" beats \"Barbie\" on all fronts without having to put up much of a fight, irrespective of what the box office figures might denote.That said, \"Barbie\" is a good film, a fun watch, that could have been so much more. The first half was a joyride providing all the fun that the film must have intended to provide during the course of its runtime. It was a job well done by the art directors and set designers as they enabled in creating a vibrant, colourful world without any trace of morbidity. The Barbie houses, the beach, the house of the Weird Barbie, the roads, the Netherlands-like fields, the sea - they were created with a perfection that one can only dream of, only to let you sink and immerse yourselves in the colours that Gerwig\\'s vision could have borrowed straight of the rainbow. To conceptualize and execute such a world is an extraordinary accomplishment with the sets perfectly complementing the colourful lives of our Barbies. The Barbies come from all walks of life, hold important positions, and stay at the frontline of Barbie life - a contrast to the human world where a bigshot at a top private firm claims to Ken that they don the mask of inclusivity so that they do not have to deal with a backlash. At the center of all these Barbies is Margot Robbie\\'s Stereotypical Barbie who is ever joyful and unfettered by emotions like grief or anxiety. She is the paragon of the beauty as it was once envisioned, hence the stereotype about her. The Kens have nothing much to do in this world other than bicker over their vulnerabilities. All was well until the real world began messing with the Barbie world and our protagonist is hit by concerning thoughts like death. Depression takes root in her mind and she has to embark on a journey to the real world to not only fix her own life but also that of her owner. \"Barbie\" should have stopped here or should have taken an alternate route to the denouement as the second half just steers out of control and every theme seemed to being heavily hammered into youe mind as if the script had lost confidence in the viewer to effortlessly let those ideas in. The last 30 minutes felt stretched out of control except for the incredibly done Ken song - one of my favourite moments from the film. Gerwig had let the viewers have most of the fun in the first hour but the script lost the steam as it trudged to the finish line. Gerwig is worthy appreciation for her vision, for the world she has accomplished in this film, for the infinite ideas she has established - feminism to motherhood to inclusivity to bending all gender stereotypes. She has been sensitive and empathetic in her handling of depression. If only she had not taken the approach of a moral parable in the second half this film could have been so much better.\"Barbie\" packs in a stellar cast with every single one of them investing the best of their qualities in the project. Robbie looks absolutely pretty as she should have in this role and handles joy, sadness, existential crisis with the capability that she as an actor has always possessed. Issa Rae as President Barbie and Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie are two other standouts. But the real star of the show is Ryan Gosling - his Ken-ergy is infectious and will keep you in splits throughout. Just look at his incredible comedic chops when Ken visits the human world. You just can\\'t have Ken-ough of Gosling\\'s Ken. \"La La Land\" showed that he could dance really well, a skill he has put effectively to use in the Ken song too.In the end, Gerwig\\'s film is a pretty looking tribute to a pretty cultural phenomena. It could have had a little more of the \"muchness\" (as the Mad Hatter would say in \"Alice in Wonderland\") in the fun department. It dazzles throughout but the baggage of its heavy-handedness drags it down to an extent. Alas!', 'If you are expecting it to be so stupid ur gonna love it... Ur in the right place. I refused to watch extras and trailers, I wanted to be surprised. And I was! It\\'s cheesey AF at first.. if u can get past 15 mins of everyone saying the name Barbie, you will survive this movie. In the beginning they \"flip\" through past Barbies and I seen quite a few that used to own.. they also \"flash\" through some barbie clothes that will bring u right back to childhood. For nastalgia sake this movie will not disappoint... For new comer\\'s sake, this movie will not disappoint! We counted the reasons why it\\'s rated PG-13 and it\\'s kinda hilarious.I hope there\\'s a second movie... Barbie and The Rockers!!!!', \"This movie is everything and more. It's comedic, colorful, entertaining, heartfelt, nostalgic, and has such a truly meaningful message that's fit for everyone.While the movie pokes fun at the patriarchy, it's a beautifully written commentary on how the patriarchy affects everyone, not just women. Where Ryan Gosling's Ken was struggling to find who he really is, because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity. There's also the more obvious example of the Barbies being brainwashed into servitude.As marvelously played by Margot Robbie, Barbie feels the struggles that many women face - where we feel lost at some point in our lives. America Ferrera's monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary. This movie positively shows the beauty of womanhood.Barbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come!\", \"So good but the only part I don't like is the scene when the boys take over the town apart from that it's perfect. Barbie is a heartwarming family movie with great actors and a great freaking plot. Its my favorite movie and its highly recommended for a family but there some bad words like vagina and penis. I think it should be recommended for 12 and over. The rating 12A (12 adult ) and it is 1h and 54m. If u don't like comedy movies ( I'm sure u like comedy's) than this movie is not for u. Thank u all for reading this review and I hope u read my other reviews. (By the way my reviews have spoilers)\", \"Gosling Robbie Made the movie. They're what makes it worthy to Watch. Every other possible meaning or message the director was aiming to Explore in the film was pointless or superficially / weakly face. Mattel tried so hard to wash its image through out Barbie's redemption that it almost appears cringe. Will Ferrell in the Same Role as he was in Zoolander or so. Finally the male figure is a bad represantation of the worst and stereotypical patriarchy which you could assist to maybe in the 80s. Despite Goslin's brilliant represantation Ken is just a stupid mamma boy without any merit. Robbie is just wonderful.\", 'The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.But the message of \"patriarchy is bad\" seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively, with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men, and i dont believe in battling hate with hate. Dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering (world dominated by men), but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal, which the barbie word is. Pinning us against each other is not helpful, as we should work together to reach equality, one cannot work without the other. What could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste.', \"What a cinematic experience. The mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination. I don't know where to start. I feel like Greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in Hollywood. This film is iconic. Using the character and icon of Barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do. Throughout the film I was always connecting it to Disney's Soul, due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message (Barbie experiencing the real life for the first time): life is unique, a beautiful gift that it's worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering - using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics, patriarchy, feminism, life as a woman in all its aspects, all in a really enjoyable, beautifully crafted comedic way. Barbie (and the married writers) manages to unite different kinds of genres (musical - Ryan Gosling is sublime in musicals... you know what I mean -, bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer) in a special way. This movie is near to perfection. The epilogue really adds to that perfection, with a heart-wrenching soundtrack by Billie Eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by Margot Robbie. It's her year, and she deserves all of it. To summarise the film: I AM KENOUGH!\", 'Me and my sister both enjoyed this film and disliked it. The beginning of the film starts off with little girls destroying baby dolls because the new \"barbie toy\" had been created. Me and my sister were shocked and also disappointed in the scene. The movie was really funny, it had us laughing a lot and we enjoyed it. They made men look absolutely stupid, as in if there was just one leadership position filled by a man it was the end of the world. That part annoyed us and we strongly disagreed w it. Overall, i think that the movie could have been better, but it wasn\\'t the worst i\\'ve ever seen. I definitely enjoyed certain moments of watching the film, but definitely not every moment. I recommend this film for the barbie world experience. I think every actor/actress fulfilled the role they played. However i don\\'t think that the story was 100% in line and think it could have been a bit better. :)', \"I almost walked out but I was with my friends. I even wore a pink dress. I really wanted to like this movie but it was way too ridiculous for my liking. I should have known that it would be more for barbie fans but I was never really into Barbie.Ryan Gosling will look back someday and wonder why he did this nonsensical movie.Margot Robbie was excellent as Barbie and if you're a fan of Barbie then you'll like the movie.I came home and had to have a glass of wine.I'm looking forward to seeing the new Tom Cruise movie...way more my style. So it really depends on your taste in entertainment. Maybe I should have had a couple of glasses of wine before going...LOL.\", 'Barbie is, in its very core, a comedy, and a funny one at that. From the opening scene, Greta Gerwig set up the mood that will run thru the entire movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both amazing, but the rest of the big ensemble is a mixed bag. This is mostly because of the writing. Will Ferrells character served no more purpose than advertise the Mattel company as goofy and \"self aware\". The third act slows the movie down, which is a shame as the first and second acts are very strong. However, when Barbie delivers it delivers. The set design are beautifully artificial. Barbie sometimes shows strokes of genius, but fails to deliver a strong end.', \"The long-awaited and well-publicized Barbie movie is a way for Mattel to apologize for the mistakes they made, to achieve greater acceptance of the new generations, trying to imply that they are going to change those mistakes, but doing it in the best way. Form of advertising possible. Visually it is a colorful and striking film, which reminds us of many Barbie ester eggs, recalling many things from childhood (I was never really a Barbie fan). It is a friendly film for adults and children, I think that each age group will understand according to\\nbe age. I knew that it couldn't be a bad movie since it has a very good director, luckily they decided to change the initial actress since the movie would be another story. It is a criticism using humor, about feminism, machismo, patriarchy, about what women face (I had never thought that Barbie was nominated by women, however her mistake was wanting perfectionism), about existential doubts, the world dominated by men on many occasions, the relationships of mothers and adolescents, the daily routine, trying not to fall into this routine and procrastinate, I think it is a film that, being well analyzed, has very good components and a very good plot, something that one never imagined from a movie about Barbie.\", \"I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings.\", \"I was excited to see this movie after hearing how much people liked it. I anticipated it having strong messages and it did, but it was a little all over the place. I'm not sure there actually was a cohesive message, but I found myself very emotional at moments during this film. I think it speaks to both men and women who feel societal pressures to be certain things and act certain ways. The music is amazing, and the Ken dance sequence might have been my favorite thing I have seen at the movies this year. This movie is also hilarious throughout. I left not knowing exactly how I was meant to feel, but I did enjoy all the pieces even if they didn't come together completely.Does NOT need a sequel or a Mattel cinematic universe! Lol.\", 'Where to begin? With flamboyance of Barbie and the emotions of Greta Gerwig, this is the best release of the year so far. To address it all to mothers, specifically, and STILL touch the hearts of girls all around. To talk so, SO honestly about what it\\'s like being a girl. To say it in the first ten minutes - \"I can have feelings and use logic at the same time and it does not take away from my worth.\" to have Barbie look at her body and hate it and to make her look at an old woman and see just how beautiful her \"imperfections\" make her. To make it about growing up, but also about remaining a child. To remind girls to be both. To make the perfect example of what adolescence means to a girl. Just genius.', \"Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot. Cuz damn that word is being said sooo many times!\", \"Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint! This one could have been a lot better.\", \"You will experience vast emotions during this film. It's a thrill to watch, funny and fresh comedy. If I had any critiques for the film, I'd put them, but I enjoyed watching and will rewatch it. I felt like a little kid again at the movies. Totally absorbed with the story. It's a fictional land, while the film is so raw. Margot Robbie is a joy to watch and showed an impressive performance. I believed she was Barbie. The movie is played out as if the characters are dolls being played with. I imagined being a kid with my dolls, thinking of similar outrageous plots, dialogue, and wardrobe changes. Anyone can enjoy this film.\", \"I had no idea what to expect, but the trailers made me smile. Every after the seeing the trailers the movie was so much more weird and wonderful and pink than I'd even imagined. I laughed so hard. There is also a sweet message about the pressures of life and society and gender roles without being preachy. It feels like a message of kindness to ourselves and to others. I now know that I am Kenough.The writing of this film was brilliant. It could have been a strange and tacky film; but instead it reminded us of the endless possibilities of stories and imaginations. The music, costumes, sets and actors all were the perfect pink sprinkles on top.\", 'Honestly this is the weirdest movie I have ever seen. It is definitely a good movie but I\\'m not sure what to make of it. The message was so convoluted that you didn\\'t know what it was trying to say.WARNING: The movie is not like \"Enchanted\" where it\\'s a fun romantic comedy. The movie is funny, but it is convoluted with allegory.Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie both are fantastic. American Ferrera also shines. Will Ferrell was meh.My biggest thing was wondering why they chose to make Mattel cartoon feeling while at the same time trying to portray the real world. You\\'re going to come out of this movie either hating it, loving it, or like me wondering what the hell you just watched.', \"I never cared for Barbie but the movie is really good I think the casting is perfect and the music and who they got to do the soundtrack I also love how they made the Barbie world a separate land and it was brighter then the whole world and I love how they went to the Mattel head quarters and the people trying to take her away and Barbie and Ken being in the real In the real world also the marketing team did amazing on the promo and advertisement on the movie with all the company's collab with Barbie and etc so overall the Barbie movie got a lot of hype and well deserved excellent film and amazing for people who love barbie.\", \"I enjoyed the creation of the Barbie world, the costumes, set design, and I think the angle they took in terms of themes was interesting and relevant. The script, however, was not that solid.They were going for a direct, transparent, explain the deep themes of the story type of dialogue, but it often had a hard time landing. Particularly at the beginning. Some things felt spoon-fed to the audience, as if they weren't going to understand the givens of Ken realizing he loved the patriarchy because he felt he had never had any voice in Barbie Land. We visually understand it, but then it is explained a fee times through on the nose dialogue which felt unnecessary.The pacing of the film feels a bit awkward at times. You also never fuuully connect with the characters and their struggles, even though Margot Roby and Ryan Gosling are amazing actors and enjoyable to watch. You're following a line of events and laid out comments about the patriarchy and the place of women in todays world. But it was exactly the most profound (which is fiiiine, it's a movie about a doll after-all, but if they were going for this pov they should've dug deeper, in my opinion).I love all the actors involved, and the work of Greta Gerwig and the work of Noah Baumbach. But this wasn't their best work.I would still recommend seeing it to form your own opinion. You can still enjoy the world, the acting, and have a laugh here and there. Also, for people who have never taken a look at our binary, sexist, and patriarchal society, it could be eye opening. For my part, I often think about how exhausting it is to live in a world where men are in most positions of power and impose their ways on others, particularly women, so I wanted more out of the argument of the movie. Deeper.\", \"With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot.\", 'The movie is colourful, fun and had a message about the, State of the world as it is today. I get the feminist message but it feels like a little exposion on how the events of the plot panned out would have helped complete it.The first half went along pretty well in tems of the Stirling but in the second half of felt something was missing in the conflict and eventual resolution.Thst said Margot Robbie was born to play this role and did it marvelously and the supporting cast was great too. America Ferrera did well as dis Ryan Gosling in a convincing Ken character.However I saw kids in the theatre and probably over 10s would get it more than younger children.', 'First, I\\'d like to clarify one thing: Barbie is not an \"Anti-Men\" or a \"Men-Hating\" Movie in any shape or form. Instead, it is a very thought-provoking exploration of contemporary ideas such as Identity, Self-discovery, Existentialism, Ethics, Feminism, Gender Roles, Consumerism, Materialism, Beauty and Body Image.Barbie feels like a satirical take on the real world, the world we live in.The opening scene of Barbie was very similar to the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey. Then we get introduced to the Barbieland, the most perfect, ideal world according to the Barbies. Everyone\\'s happy, everyone\\'s joyful, and cheerful, and most importantly everything is being run by the Barbies. EVERYTHING. Ken is just a supporting character. There won\\'t be a Ken with Barbie.But then things start to change, Barbie talks about DEATH. Mind you, nobody dies in Barbieland, they get discontinued by MATTEL. Then Barbie embarks on a journey of self-discovery accompanied by Ken.One of my favorite scenes is when Barbie and Ken are in the real world and both of them get catcalled. The stark contrast between the reaction of both Barbie and Ken to the catcalling was portrayed very accurately.Ken learns about Patriarchy in the real world. Ken used to live in a world where everything is run by Barbie but in the real, it\\'s literally the opposite. Ken takes all he has learned in the real world back to Barbieland and changes everything. He literally changes Barbieland to \"Kendom Land\".Meanwhile, Barbie is trying to find answers to why she doesn\\'t feel perfect anymore or why she doesn\\'t feel pretty anymore.We get a glimpse of the Mattel Corporation as well and how literally every working person is like a doll.There is this one monologue in the film which stands out. The monologue which helped Barbie get out of her Existential Crisis.The last 15-20 minutes of the film are perfect, the set designing, the dialogues, everything - it was perfect.If you are someone who loves great films and enjoys great storytelling, you\\'ll love Barbie.Give it a chance and you\\'ll not regret it.', \"I really like how smartly this movie has been made. They kept the basics of the Barbie as we we know it intact, the fake beach, the food, the car, etc etc., they showed all Barbie's from all ethnicities and than they try to blend it with the real world to give us two perspectives, Beautiful!The overall acting, musical score, stage production, and the wardrobe is well thought and balanced. Thought at times I felt there were some gaps here and there which goes quite unnoticed.Over all a good watch for the all time favorite doll that had been know for generations.Definitely worth a watch!7/10 for this one!\", 'Not a fan. Went in with fairly high expectations but was let down by the emptiness of it all. Sure, it has a solid message of empowerment of women but why is it so boring? Will Farrell was visibly strained trying to make something of his underwritten and unfunny part. Margo Robbie didn\\'t have enough to do for much of the film. Only Ryan Gosling had a complete character arc. I had two central problems: first, I had no idea this was such an infomercial for Mattel which never fails to get their logo into nearly every frame, even during the end credits. If someone in the company had written the first draft, I would have believed it. Second, the \"rules\" of this made-up world were vague and constantly changing. The filmmakers ripped off Wes Anderson\\'s settings but didn\\'t comprehend the unity in his designs, stories, and performances. Wes Anderson always feels like he\\'s about to break the fourth wall but never does. \"Barbie\" kept breaking it over and over so that it was near impossible to fully immerse yourself in its world. I\\'m glad for a female director to now be empowered, but I would have liked to see a much more coherent vision.', \"I'm a huge fan of Barbie, so when I heard there was a movie coming out, I was beyond excited & I certainly wasn't disappointed when I got to see it!The cast are incredible & all seem to bounce off of each other, the story was funny but also heartwarming at the same time, and the attention to detail was marvellous, in true Barbie fashion.One thing I really enjoyed was how it managed to pay tribute to so many different variations of Barbie, shout out to Weird Barbie! (We all had a weird Barbie!)Overall the film was truly a pleasure to watch & I just wish I could go to Barbie-Land, someone get me some Rollerblades please?\", \"Okay, so I'm a 30 year old woman, feminist and cinephile. I left the theater feeling both confused and a bit disappointed. I really wanted to like this film. It's about damn time we have more female directors topping the box office. And I gotta say, the costume and set design of this film was incredible. But the entire plot of the story was all over the place, leaving me feeling little to no empathy for the characters, albeit Ken. Now Ryan Gosling MADE this movie. Though at times, I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be the antagonist or puppy dog we were supposed to sympathize with. What really got to me about this movie were the stereotypes, which just contradicted the entire message. Scenes that were meant to be moving fell flat. Characters had very little development. There was no real conflict or climax. The end was funny but switched the mood entirely too soon. And hey, I actually love The Godfather. I still love it more than Barbie. And I'm a chick...so there ya go.\", \"Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.Jam packed with in-jokes, sly references and even a Mattel-censored F-bomb, Barbie is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. Most of the satire will fly over kids' heads, as we had a theatre-full of Belgrave's finest letting their vile offspring literally run riot under the screen.Luckily, the movie was so good we kept our teacher voices to ourselves. Over to Oppenheimer on Sunday. 9/10.\", 'Barbie is a fun little movie that is, at its core, a satire on traditional gender roles in society. Thrown in is some mild commentary on materialism and how reality seldom (if ever) lives up to our youthful expectations. Some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive anti-male agenda but I can\\'t see it that way. It\\'s simply a movie, based on a toy, that dares to actually not take itself seriously. Look at other films in this genre such as Battleship, GI Joe and the Transformers films. All take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark \"realism\". Barbie doesn\\'t do that. It reveals that it\\'s a joke in the very first scene.Is this a great movie? Absolutely not. But it is fun, entertaining summertime fluff. Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both look and act perfectly plastic. The set design is brilliantly colorful and the whole thing moves at a pleasant pace. See it and enjoy.', \"I really enjoyed the movie, but it also tore me to pieces. I saw myself reflected in many very difficult situations in my life as a woman, beyond the fact that my feminism allows me to be aware of many things. I got home thinking a lot.Margot Robbie's performance is incredible, it really makes you feel all the sadness, despair and finally the relief of being a real and imperfect woman. Ken was also very good, I feel that Gosling is going to win an Oscar.Separate point for the costumes, scenarios, makeup excellently done. Barbie is undoubtedly the movie of the year 2023. In short, watch it. It's a great movie. Thank you thank you thank you.\", 'Ryan Gosling as Ken I loved too much, but Margot Robbie as Barbie is perfect.I understood the message very well, it\\'s great to see how they destroy little by little the stereotypes of a \"pretty\" person and replace it with the reality that many human beings live. And after all, men and women (and every living being) deserve to be happy.One of the scenes I loved, aside from the opening reference, is the \"Just Ken Exclusive\" scene. I would have loved to see more of Ken!!!! And don\\'t forget that you can be whatever you want to be.By the way, I absolutely hated the advertising to a certain car brand.', \"Definitely not understanding why this movie was over hyped. What age demographic is this movie for exactly? It's not a movie for little kids. Maybe pre teen girls? And I can't understand how they wouldn't be bored with this film. It's music every couple of mins and everything is way over the top. Actors were great but the script isn't entertaining at all. Honestly the trailer was more fun than the movie. My kids were bored and wanted to leave before the end. But after we made it through the first half of the movie, we might as well suck it up until the end. All in all, an amazing cast and set, but it falls short in actually entertaining the audience.\", 'This movie touches on complex themes the way the Truman show and West World were able to do but in a way that was more glittery and a bit more superficial. Because it juxtaposes a world that was created in the imagination of women (Barbieland) vs. Men (the real world), it has a bit of a devastating conclusion for both: mainly that people struggle to live up to ideals, resulting in feelings of alienation and depression that they try to hide. What I appreciated so much about the movie was its commentary on men feeling like they need a \"Barbie\" at their side to feel successful. It occurred in Barbieland but honestly it was a commentary on both men and women who feel that way in both worlds. It\\'s easier to think that someone else will help us determine why we are here instead of really exploring who we are and what our purpose is as individuals. There\\'s a loneliness that rung so true at the heart of the Ken experience. Curious what men thought of it and if they could relate.Set design and visual humor were awesome. Everyone played their role with a lot of heart. My soon to be 11 year old daughter loved it as well. It was just wonderfully entertaining.', 'Barbie provided the ying to Oppenheimer\\'s yang. It was significantly better than I anticipated due to it\\'s artistic filming, fun casting, and plot. I expected a 3/10 and it was twice as nice, coming in at a solid 6/10.What to like: The sets were a fun mix of real word items and \"Barbified\" backdrops/objects. This quickly normalized the weird blend of a live-action movie based on a toy. The star-studded cast was fantastic! It was fun to watch so many familiar faces in such silly roles.What not to like: The part where Barbie failed was in it\\'s preachiness. I\\'m fine with films having an underlying message- and I even agree with the overall message it seems Barbie was trying to make. America Ferrera\\'s rant towards the end was a bit too heavy/angry for me and made it seem that women had cornered the market on every hardship imaginable. This angry turn made the movie far less fun.', \"Rarely have I seen a film that can be so heavy handed with its messaging and at others totally confusing. The script is an utter mess, and I felt sorry for the poor parents that brought kids along to what was very much an adult film. The 'real world' was no more real than Barbieland and can anyone explain the point of Will Ferrells character or why he needed to go to Barbieland.Very few films have I every wanted to end so badly and this one ended so, so badly with the inclusion of the ghost of the Barbie maker just to hammer home a few more points in case you missed them. Just don't believe the hype or the positive reviews, this film is the worst film I've seen since in a long, long time.\", \"A very confusing plot, under-developed characters and a haughty attitude to glorify the plastic doll in all possible ways, mixing patriarchy, feminism, women's rights, gender equality, sex etc etc. Mattel did everything they could to ruin a good concept, but I am sorry it's just a plastic doll.There are some interesting points, like the emotions of Barbie and Ken when they visit the real world for the first time, but they quickly move away from it and is not fully developed. The way they move in the Barbie world, is it children moving them in the real world, and speaking for them? Not-developed. The weird doll, what happened to her, how does she feel? Not-developed. The mother and daughter role? What's their purpose? Not-developed. The CEO and CFO? What's their story? What's their purpose? Not-developed. That Alain dude? Not-developed.\", 'It\\'s a good movie, worth the watch but nothing special. It was really overhyped worldwide and although it\\'s a good movie, it\\'s nothing special. I believe standards have gone up in recent times and movies are getting better, and this is below that. However it tells an important story, and is a somewhat fun and education movie. I would rate it 6.5-7/10. Even though it\\'s a \"Barbie\" movie, kids under probably 13 wouldn\\'t understand the movie well. The moral of the story isn\\'t just Barbie\\'s and their fun little world. It\\'s somewhat serious, and kids would only see the Barbie part, and not understand the point of the movie.', \"The Barbie Movie stars Ryan Gosling (Ken), Issa Rae (President Barbie), Margot Robbie (Barbie), Will Ferrell. (Matel CEO), Simu Liu (Ken), and Kingsley Ben-Adir (Ken).Directed by Greta Gerwig and written by; Noah Baumbach and Gerwig-the crisis in Barbie (2023) is that Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.There are several highlights to the Barbie Movie. Ben-Adir (Ken) changed his voice to that of Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as his Marvel Cinematic Universe Character named Gravik. Only several men in the cinema understood the MCU reference. Speaking of men-Barbie references male dominance in the real world as something that is concealed by men obtaining Phd degrees and certifications. Moreover, men are portrayed as fools in this movie. Gloria played by America Ferrera has a husband who struggles with the Spanish language and the Ken's think more with the head on their groin areas rather than their heads with a brain in it.All in all Barbie is a good movie for women empowerment, I give it a 5/10. Nonetheless, if a Barbie movie universe was created then I would most likely support it for the funny male depictions.\", \"Finally got around to viewing this, and it was really great fun. A solid story. It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.Margo Robbie pretty much owns this movie, and rightly so. She and Ryan Gosling take over the screen and must of had a load of fun.The set design is very inventive and is very pivotal to the films plot. Never seen so many high heels in a mainstream movie. So many great costumes that help along with the pop background.Really silly and funny look at life, very metaphoric, plenty of fun here, the screening was full, just 6 seats left.\", \"So bad it's good! What a political/philosophical/artistic/stylistic/linguistic/directoral/musical mess! Who is this film even for? I'm guessing teenage airheads - the sort that happily equate a Barbie doll with the Nazi war machine, as is done in the film. Wow! If the aim was feminism, I'd call this an own goal. So whinging, so reliant on gender stereotypes and societal stereotypes, so busy sermonising, it achieves nothing. The reasoning behind the film's reasoning wouldn't stand up to two minutes of scrutiny. Who wrote this junk? Who directed it? Who signed it off? Honestly, I'm not kidding when I say it's so bad it's good; I'd happily rewatch it just to marvel again at the grinding cognitive dissonance. I'm looking forward to the IMDB rating dropping - already below 7.5.\", \"It's impressive how so many messages were cleverly conveyed through a well-known brand.The movie addressed a range of great themes, skillfully communicated through colors and a cute fairytale-like presentation.-One of the key messages is when Barbie talks to Ken in the end and her words focus mostly on the fact that individuals should find their completeness within themselves before entering a relationship. Exploring personal preferences and self-awareness is vital before projecting unresolved issues onto a partnership. Developing a strong self-relationship is a foundational step before building connections with others.-The movie also transforms the traditional Barbie world to a world where men pursue their interests while Barbies serve them. This shift seems to show the challenge of achieving equality in relationships, highlighting the struggle to establish and maintain balance between feminism and patriarchy.-A particularly touching moment is Barbie creator's monologue. It resonates as an empowerment boost for women who stay in abusive situations due to their lack of self-confidence and fear of taking control of their lives.-The film addresses also how society imposes unrealistic role models, leading to personal dissatisfaction. Barbie has been/still is an example of those models. However, if our real lives start being reflected into the doll, we will notice how miserable and depressing we all are.It's sad to see negative reviews for this impactful attempt that managed to encapsulate these messages.\", 'I\\'m not a fan of modern day musicals. I strongly disliked LaLaLand, could never get through it. Barbie on the other hand I watched all the way through even though I thought it was sugary sweet. Ick. Peer pressure, \"ya gotta see it!\" The last 15 minutes of dialogue in the movie was very good. Actually wish I would have just watched that last 15 minutes rather than the entire movie. The actors/actresses I felt did a good job on their characters. It would have been better, in my opinion, if Barbie was an actual movie without all the plastic sets, the portal from land to sea etc. With all the technology out there surely the sets could have been realistic.', 'Barbie is full of pros and consThe movie was fun and had wild adventures. I loved the fun characters and the dancing was INCREDIBLE! It was colorful and bright. Characters popping up from left and right exuding glitter and delight! The movie was all-around Barbie to the maximum even through the outfits!(Women are powerful and can make a change) The message was...stated...kind of...I think so...? The movie did not put it really out there. There were many moments that made you stop and say \"huh?\" as well as insert that awkward laugh you give when your nan/gramps/great aunt/kid says something they really shouldn\\'t have said, or known, outloud. It gave me the feel of \"I Feel Pretty\"; movie with the intention of getting a message across, but never really gets it there. Even the ending made me say \"Are you serious?\"Overall, if you are looking for a movie with a good time, this one can be it. I did laugh a lot though, so there is that to look forward to.', \"This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding. It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.I will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater, know your director. This was not a film created to advertise for Barbie, this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for Oscar's. They know what they want to say and why. The target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like Patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie. But don't let this deter you. There's enough music, humor, and and character development for Barbie and Ken to keep the audience entertained even if it's over their head.\", 'The film was good and there were scenes that were fun to watch. One thing it failed was being funny and there were a couple of overrated scenes. It was entertaining and many people who have seen it or are about see it would agree with me. I would not see it again anytime more this year but maybe in two years I would watch it again. There is definitely way too much hype and at least in my opinion it is not as good as everyone is saying it is. This is most money and the most successful movie a Warner bros movie has been. The certain people that would love this movie is girls. Also women and men age 30 - 50. If you a women or girl or a men I would definitely recommend this film.', 'My only-ever memory of a Barbie doll was the one my cousin sister once owned, and I secretly sabotaged, owing to some temporary argument in our childhood. I do remember that it was a stereotypical version, with blonde hair and a pink (or some shade of it) dress. I made that once-good-looking doll into Crazy Barbie, by drawing weird shapes on her face, pulling some of her hair out, and twisting (at least) one of her plastic limbs. I also remember hiding away some of the crockery (tea cups and the like) shortly after. Well, this film brought back that repressed memory, which I don\\'t think I apologized to her for. Of course I did so, afterwards, and that\\'s how rewarding the movie felt for me.The first act of Barbie was deliberately \"plastic\", as if Gerwig was trying to reinforce the idea of how a perfectly feminine world exists. The \"Hi Barbie\"s were starting to get a bit annoying, and the unabashed celebration of \"every night being girls night\", and women basically holding all decision-making power came across as Gerwing trying to impose the blunt idea that if women are involved in everything, the world automatically becomes a better place - no questions asked. When you perceive this through a man\\'s lens, it\\'s actually pretty brilliant. This is exactly what women must feel, at least frequently, when they see us celebrating masculinity even to toxic levels. Robbie is the perfect choice to portray stereotypical Barbie, and that\\'s purely because she can make us feel for the character\\'s existential crisis just as much as we can adore her looks.The film\\'s binding strength, however, is Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken. As the film progressed, it almost felt like if this were a movie about Barbie questioning her existence and just fighting Mattel\\'s idea of corporate villainy, that would\\'ve been clichéd. Ken\\'s presence adds an intriguing layer - when he and Barbie make it to the real world, and concludes that \"men rule the real world\", he becomes the antithesis. He gathers all Kens in Barbieland and makes them acknowledge patriarchy. At this point, as much as I was entertained by Ken\\'s antics, Barbie\\'s realizations, and the wonderful production design, costumes, and soundtrack, I wasn\\'t sure how Gerwig would tackle the final act. The first two acts came across as both sides being somewhat toxic, what with the sidelining of the opposite gender for no apparent reason.But, the final act is a masterstroke. Other than Gerwig\\'s decision NOT to fully antagonize the corporate that manufactures Barbie dolls (and their excessive product placements), because well, they co-produced it, the writing is brilliant. The fact that they allowed Gerwig to go this far itself is refreshing. It acknowledges errors on both ends, and understands how a balance is entirely significant. It asks Ken to stand on his own two feet, without having Barbie by his side always. It also pays tribute to Barbie\\'s creator (for all her faults, including tax evasion), adding a couple of conversational scenes featuring her and Margot\\'s Barbie that gives the latter some level of character closure. This is how you make a film based on a toy, and give it the depth it wholly deserves. Shine on, Greta! :)', \"I enjoyed the movie a lot with many jokes and sarcasm the characters keep throwing.It was interesting and unexpected view to face that barbie is a matriarchal concept. On the other hand, miserable but thriving Kens' lives with various music was very comical and fun. Such a landscape and world-setting is something only few of us have seen in real world where women have increasingly thrived for social power.Meanwhile, the storyline is pretty straightforward. It is a typical fantasy movie that a character goes to real world, cause a problem intertwined with the imaginary and real world and solve them together with real humans. So in that sense, there was no sequence of surprise as such. However, it was a movie with a good length of about 90 minutes, to casually enjoy watching with your family and friends!\", \"I've just taken 2 nieces, 9 and 14, to see Barbie. They both hated it... really, really hated it!! And, me: I'm just stunned. I've no idea what I've just seen.If Barbie is meant to be a dark satire, it's alright. If it's meant to be a kids movie, it's unconscionably bad. And, I'm totally confused which type of movie it's supposed to be. What the literal heck is going on!!If you're looking for a twenty first century dark cultural satire, you're at least in your twenties, you've an open mind, this is your movie... maybe. If you're looking for a movie to take your kids to, before getting ice cream, this is absolutely not the movie you're looking for. My advice: give Barbie a miss and go straight for the ice cream. You will be so much happier. I wish I had.\", \"I loved to watch the movie, it had all elements one would have want to have seen. The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.\", \"Honestly I loved it. The colors were brilliant. The usage of popular artists and actors as really well done. All of the characters were brilliantly casted. The it was intriguing, and generally attriactive for both young and mature audiences. I think because of this though, it just didn't hit as hard for me. The messages within the movie were quite profound, and many of my friends ended up emotional due to its relatability and the fact that nothing actually changed at the end. Good overall, stellar for younger audiences, and would 100% recommend to a younger child. Not my color palette, so it was a bit bright. Not riveting. Just good.\", \"I saw this movie in theatres, and I found it kind of underwhelming. Each and every act of the film feels so different and disconnected from the other, and by the end it feels like the plot looses traction. But that doesn't mean I thought the movie was bad, I thought it was funny and charming all throughout, but I guess my issue is that I'm in the wrong demographic. Near the beginning and near the end, there's a strong theme of motherhood and the troubles of being a woman, and as a man, I can't relate. As a result, I had a hard time relating to a lot of this movies big plot points and emotional moments. And on top of that, halfway though it becomes exceedingly boring. But overall, I'd say it's a solid 7/10.\", \"I expected a funny, easy-going movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone. I was amazed by the depth of the story. Feminism done right, without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases. A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing. Beautiful story abour equality, feminism, finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world.\", 'Walking into the theater I was expecting a silly, outrageous, fun contrast to the competing new release of \"Oppenheimer\", but instead I found much more. Not only did this movie have incredible humor, but a deep insight to what it means to be a woman. The light it brought to the deep connection to mother\\'s and daughters...especially the moment shared between Margot Robbie and Ruth Handler, was nothing short of a tear-jerker. Not only that, but the wide spectrum of representation of connection between women was remarkable; from the shared struggle of patriarchal restraints we experience to the common childhood memories of playing with dolls. I have seen some critics who hate magic, fun, and women, be quick to hate on the heavy speech America Ferrera gives in the third act about standards women must meet. Sure, it didn\\'t fit the theme of Barbieland\\'s perfect, pink atmosphere, but it was a powerful message needed to strengthen the impact of the movie. Her message was followed by an applause by the audience of the theater I was in.I left the theater in awe of how incredible this movie was and how incredible this movie made me feel. It spoke to me in ways that cheesy, \"relatable\", lazily anti-capitalist and cheap feminist media could never do. This movie is brilliant and inspiring for young girls such as myself. I felt loved and seen throughout this whole movie and felt so strongly about it I went through the hassle of making a damn IMDB account and writing an essay that wasn\\'t required by a teacher or school project. I actually felt the need to share how this movie impacted me instead of letting the horse loving Ken\\'s of the world speak over the women who felt a real connection to this movie. It is beautiful and a must watch.', \"The movie as it is is really great and the work on it deserves all the best critics...\\nBut I personally haven't strongly connected to the storyline. They really could have came up with much better strory line which would make this amazingly done movie even better.I don't know but watching the trailer for the movie I thought that it would be story about Ken being spy from the outside world, but it turned out not to be true.Also I do not find the film funny at all, maybe I did not understand some jokes, maybe I ignored some but I don't think it's funny at all.But as I said at the very beginning the movie directing is really great and the whole movie team did the great job as well as actors did. <3.\", 'Barbie was hilarious, emotional and exciting. I LOVED the wardrobe and props - very colorful and exact replicas of what I played with in the 90s. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie - casting was perfect. I especially loved the humor and emotional grasp this movie had on the audience in the movie theatre. This is definitely a feel good movie and I hope they continue the franchise. I have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner, in good way! There is a lot of action, dancing and surprise ha ha moments. This is perfect for families and adults really; go see it!', \"Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.\", \"The hype and marketing drag me to this movie. I felt a little disappointed. Even though I did not had high expectations. It was not a bad movie. But it clearly isn't deserving that 7+ from me that it has now (in my opinion). The beginning is so strong but towards the end it's getting more disappointing. Great acting, great visuals/colors but sadly a very bad story. And yes the end is nicely done. But overall.. Not so great. Probs to the creators of reaching this milestone with great marketing and all the hype around it like tiktoks. Just watch it at home on a sunday where you wanna clear your mind a bit and have a little laugh.\", \"Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.\", \"Barbie is a movie that you start laughing of the critics that are put in such an intelligent way (you have to think fast between laughs), amazed by the idea of a perfect world and suddenly they start to go in your feelings and bring out so many realizations about yourself with funny dialogs. We never goin to forget what it is see Margot and Ryan such an incredible performance the way them put so many emotions and still keep that doll mindset is brilliant and for Greta all my reverence it's breathtaking think that she decided to go up front with such strong movie and we didn't expect anything different from her. Oscar winners here we go.\", \"I am going to be so shocked if this isn't the biggest movie of the year. Barbie was fun, hilarious, while also being real, and heart wrenching. I found myself laughing and crying throughout the film. The movie is incredibly well done, and the entire cast was phenomenal. I highly encourage everyone to watch the film, it perfectly balanced real, current issues while remaining a really fun film.Margot Robbie blew the role of Barbie out of the water, and Ryan Gosling as Ken was absolute perfection. Their interactions had me (and the theatre) absolutely dying. I can't wait to watch this movie over and over again!\", \"You don't know what to expect before watching Barbie, and I can assure you it met my expectations and exceeded them!I really recommend you watching it! Such a great work behind and such a great movie. It touches topics among feminism, the patriarchy and how hard and difficult it's to be a woman.The actors did amazing and Greta did such a great job with this movie, it's what we all need and wanted.Also shoutout to the music from the movie and the amazing songs that the artists have created for it. I totally recommended it! I watched it some days ago and can't wait to go watch it again!!!!!\", 'Barbie is not just a stereotypical Hollywood film to celebrate the well-known brand. But it dives in deeper into more self existence, gender equality and journey of life. The messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all, barring the Mattel Company staff scenes and characters that doest not land. They are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film . The third act feels over-bloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start. The actors , Robbie, Gosling & Ferrera are standouts!', \"I honestly cannot understand those rating on here. The first half ot the movie is exactly what I expected from a barbie movie; it's fun, it's pink and it was just a great watch but then (oh lord) the second half started. Although I understand that the producers try to address certain issues in society but this has absolutely no place in a Barbie movie. I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it. It leaves a bitter taste behind and destroys the good vibes from the beginning of the movie. I'm extremely disappointed.\", \"Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand. But the movie brought so much more depth and substance. Be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions!\", \"7.5/10: VERY GOODThis movie is very strange, but also very fun, it is well crafted, well acted and the humour is amazing. But where this movie fails is when it tries to make itself seem like a very important movie (in some parts) when the overall tone is light-hearted comedy. The scenes when it is trying to prove that also seem overlong. But, those scenes are funny, as is the rest of the film. I also enjoyed the direction it took with this not really being a children's film.Overall, i really enjoyed this movie, it has great humour, and great performances, but some scenes go on for too long. A very good and funny film.\", 'Greta gerwig does better to feminism than judith butler with this brilliant piece.Margot robbie, ryan gosling, america ferrera they all marvelous in the movie. I believe cillian murphy will get the oscar but gosling is such a good challenge with his portrayal. Also, america ferrera is a good actress but somehow she always plays similar woman portrayals, i wish she would try thriller genre, she has that aura in her. Will ferrell was too much for me, he also plays same characters for such long time.The main message in the movie which \" a woman can do/be whatever/whoever she wants\" is crystal clear. In a much better way than twisting old fairtales to \"girlboss\" movies which does no good to strong womanhood, au contraire, being confusing for girls to be strong/leader in anytime in any circumstances. Feminism is about having uninterrupted free will whether to be a mum or a boss or both and knowing those are all equally valid like when men does exactly the same and stay men enough.', \"I found this film to be disappointing and and an overall letdown, to say the least.The humour, acting, soundtrack, casting & costumes were AMAZING. Don't get me started on the dance choreography and the sets. I found that those aspects really created an amazing atmosphere for what the perfect Barbie world is was intended to be. Michael Cera was absolutely hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing at the broken barbie, played by Kate McKinnon.Nevertheless, although it was clear they were trying to exaggerate the message on purpose, I found the plot to be just.. stupid. Barbie fights the patriarchy, or, Ken on a horse. I found the humour during multiple points in the movie to be dry, especially stressing how much Ken loves horses.The ending, I found to be mushy. I was expecting something better, and just kind of felt let down. Almost like it was lazy.In conclusion, I'd give this movie a solid six out of ten. It's kind of sad, as I am the targeted audience for this film- a young, feminist, progressive woman. Don't get me wrong, this movie was great at parts- but, in the end, was definitely overhyped.\", \"I was all in for this movie before I saw it. As time went by I got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and I'd inevitably be disappointed. Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.Barbie is funnier and more touching than I was expecting. It's just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about Barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way. I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can. Going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful. Fill two hours of your time with joy and Kenergy! We are all Kenough.\", \"In spite of the crying child in the movie theater, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I did not know what to expect going in. I was pleasantly surprised and found myself giggling at each unexpected turn of the story. It was hilarious watching Ken become infatuated with the patriarchy and then quickly shifting to find Barbie coming to terms with the pains of reality kept me on my toes. And these two competing outlooks found a beautiful synthesis at the end. Funny. Heartwarming. I learned more about Barbie than I ever thought I would. I didn't even know about all the different outfits you could buy for your Barbie. And I am now aware of the existence of Mattel. Hopefully whoever runs their company is doing a better job than Will Ferrell.\", \"The movie is great. Everyone says it's very preachy but I actually think the societal expose is done in a very tasteful manner. It makes you think about the world we live in and points out ridiculous things that have always been there but we never paid attention to - for example, why most cash has famous men on them, and not one woman (with some exceptions around the world, of course). It also presents Ken the way women have been portrayed in movies since the beginning of the movie industry - clingy, confused, a bit inadequate, annoying, etc.It's smart, it's very funny, it's interesting and it deserves the hype.\", 'So we wanted to have our own Barbenheimer and after weeks after we saw Oppenheimer we went to Barbie.We liked the colorful, trashy looking Barbie World. It just burned the eyes becaus of the colorful play.The cast was great Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are the perfect Barbie and KenNobody cares about AllenThe soundtrack was also greatWe liked the social critical aspect but sadly the themes they criticisied werent taking deeper but just threatened superficialAlso a lot of Jokes werent that fllg or that bangerAnd some Jokes were very repetitive\\nalso the Musical moments where at the end too much same the too much long scene with the creator of Barbie.', \"Sorry to say I hated it . As a gay man i love a bit of camp and irony and adore stories like Toy Story and Shrek and one of my favourite films ever is Baz Lurman's Moulin Rouge but this was just vacuous and appalling scripted and mediocre at best .It wasn't oily and savage enough for a Brit like me who grew up on Monty Python and ridiculous comedy or satire enough , satire has to be dead pan to make it credible whereas this pile of poo meandered around endlessly looking for a joke and misfiring on many occasions . As a gay man i did like Ken's cowboy hat and could appreciate the ludicrous nature of the urban cowboy and had that one laugh at that moment but the rest i endured . I rarely walk out of a movie but really had to try hard to stay to the bitter end .\", 'As we all know the title of the movie suggest fun, tons of \\'cheesy\\' moments, drama and a lot of imaginations. I entered the theater expecting the same and placed all my expectations low and just go how the film flows. Surprisingly, it has a lot of funny moments in the film, at times \\'silly\\', but it was all understandable and placed creatively and entertaining. Margot Robbie as \"Barbie\" was surely a perfect role of her, while Ryan Gosling as \"Ken\" did the same and he was more funnier as expected! Visual effects were cool to watch and soundtrack was for me, a phenomenal! People do see mixed reviewed after seeing it, but do see Barbie as a film and enjoy its ride!', \"A movie that delivered a great few laughs, with Gosling taking the show. Margot was fantastic, really showcasing her talent as an actor. However, for the main character of the show it did not seem that way - Ken took most of the limelight. Rightfully so with Ryan playing a stellar part.The story starts off light hearted and fun but takes a dive with preaching against the patriarchy. While granted in this day and age, there's a limit to the level of guff one can take.A colourful and fun movie that always tries to be more than it can be. Probably not a good idea to bring young kids as the premise and message will go over their heads.\", 'I saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience. However, I\\'ve needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that I wasn\\'t sure how to feel about. First, Ken. The character himself was hilarious and Ryan Gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice. I loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking, (like, the guy just wanted to learn about horses! But pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere, so Ken, being naive, just falls into it), as well as the societal expectation of *needing* to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent, leading into incel ideology.The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how in the end, after he became his normal self, it felt as if the movie just expected me to be laughing along with him again... like, I still don\\'t wanna be rooting for this guy. Seeing people\\'s response to him as a character after the movie had me confused. I understand, Ryan Gosling is so fine, but Ken is not your babygirl! He still tried to install a patriarchal state and never really apologized!!The plot with the real-world Mattel executives also just felt a little unnecessary to me. It was funny, don\\'t get me wrong, but it just kind of happened and I wasn\\'t sure what to glean from it. At one point I found myself thinking, like, what happened to those guys?? And then they just kinda showed up at the end. I also know it was meant to be commentary on Mattel\\'s predominantly male leadership, but... like, YOU are Mattel. You have a male CEO. Like thanks for addressing it, but you have no room to talk.I think some of the time with this unnecessary plot point could\\'ve been used to touch a bit more on body image issues, because that is a HUGE criticism of the Barbie brand. Like, okay. You had one token fat Barbie with an otherwise entirely straight-sized cast. But some of the jokes were just like \"pregnant people are weird 😂\" and they never entirely said \"hey cellulite is not scary its just how it happens\"\\nI think they *tried* to do something about aging being beautiful but it was not really explicit enough to come across. I think it could\\'ve been pretty easy to incorporate a scene, like when Barbie tried tea for the first time, to be like wow! Indulging in pleasures with your food is good and not an indicator of your moral value!Despite my criticisms, I would say this movie is a must-watch. The points it makes are really important. And I actually found the comedy funny instead of cringe, which is rare for me with these types of films!More of a 7.5/10 than a 7, if I had to say.', 'Yet I loved the performances from both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and the incredible aspects of feminism and battling misogyny, I felt untouched by the film at some points. Mainly most of the characters in the \\'Real World\\' - For example; Will Ferrell\\'s character was completely useless and didn\\'t add much to the film as a whole, and DEAR GOD did Connor Swindells contribute absolutely nothing to this film. Personally it got to the point where I felt as if this film should\\'ve just been a biopic about Ruth Handler, plus Rhea Perlman\\'s performance as Ruth Handler was just exciting and very heartfelt/heartwarming at the same time.Just overall, Most aspects of the film I did enjoy, it was just little things here and there, useless characters, messy writing and dialogue and the \"joke\" about Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League didn\\'t sit well with me.I will say I did like this film, I just didn\\'t LOVE it.', \"I think the idea is great and all but honestly for a movie about feminism the most enjoyable parts were the ken parts and its nothing we've never seen/heard before you know. Like the whole speech part ive heard all that a million trillion times. I struggled so hard to get through the movie the plot was hard to follow and the 'barbieland' doesnt really make sense. I also thought some stuff was just ridiculous like how they travel to the 'real world'. And im saying this as a woman and all but i think they could of done such a better job with a feminst movie honestly. Idk how people were crying im sorry JSHDS.\", \"I enjoyed the film more for its choreography and the characters' sympathy than for the confusing message. Is it that Ken should understand he was created to be Barbie's friend forever? Is it that a man in love must surrender to a second place? I hope I can read the actual purpose of the story from the writers.Barbieland is shown as a happy monotonous human-like world with empty containers resembling our not so happy monotonous real life where men condescend with a higher ranked male model, something a second rank character wished to be back at his fantasy world. Please, if anyone finds out the actual mess-age let me know.\", \"This had a great concept but utterly failed, couldn't understand why Barbie had to just be so mean to Ken. First part was good then just went downhill from there. We kept thinking when is this going to end. We laughed so hard over the movie being so pointless and the sheer stupidity of the storyline. The only best part was when Barbie told the old lady she was beautiful and of Ryan Gosling singing. I loved Barbies but not this way. Margot Robbie is a great actress and I have loved all her movies and she was a great Barbie, and I loved her emotions in the movie but the part was not scripted well for her. They made a fool of her and Ryan Gosling. The writers could have done so much more for these great actors in this movie.\", \"Greta Gerwig did it. Broke the ceiling financially for a movie directed by a woman.I like all of her work and the Barbie theme was a daring one to take on. Then again she created a powerful version of Little Women. I also figured if Isa Rae agreed to be in this, there had to be more to it.It was so much funnier than expected. They figured out how to not make a parody of Barbie and Ken. That's no small task.I don't want to give away anything because everyone is going to see themselves in this in another way. It's clever, thoughtful, and so funny. The actors performed to perfection.There's a lot to unpack in this movie. I want to watch it again. It has all the makings of a classic and a cult film.\", \"Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.For the story itself - sure, there were some morals and statements presented but it was a bit flat and a lot of the same. I left feeling totally underwhelmed. Gosling was great though. A few bits did make me laugh but it struggled to hold my attention. As sometimes happens, a lot of the funny parts were in the film trailers. I wouldn't watch it a second time through.\", \"This movie represents in such a beautiful way what it is like to be a woman, and the grief we might feel growing up as one. I was so incredibly touched.Margo's acting was excellent and she is the perfect fit for Barbie.As well as Ryan. Perfect casting.I genuinely felt overflowing with love for women and felt the need to hug or hold hands with those around me.This movie did an excellent job making us women feel seen, not only as the 'girl boss' and other outdated feminist catchphrases, but also as the depth we have, and the devastating grief we feel when growing up as little girls into a world that wasn't as sympathetic as we initially thought it would be. Unfortunately it is mainly because of men and the patriarchy..\\nThe thing with these type of movies is that a woman's perspective and a man's perspective are completely different.. most women I know that watched the movie felt as I did - love, grief, touched and understood.The men that have watched the movie did love it as well (and some hated it because of toxic masculinity) but most of them weren't touched. And I think that made me a little heartbroken..\\nOther than that - it's truly is a feminist masterpiece.I will definitely will be watching again.\", \"It got a 3 because there were a few laughs.But if we are being true to Barbie, she is 19, Ken is 17, so these two leads are too old to play these characters. But that aside. This was a terribley bad movie. The story line was so silly, the characters were so stupid, in the literal sense. I was really looking forward to watching this with my daughter, well the whole family really, but my daughter especially, and she hated the movie. The whole family did. We were all bored, all didn't like the story, all thought it was stupid. I always judge how bad a movie is when an entire room sits in total disappointment at the end.We all couldn't wait to see this, we wanted it to be amazing. It wasn't even close.Major, major disappointment. Sadly.\", 'Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I\\'m not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell \"the message\". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn\\'t there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did.', 'The film\\'s marketing portrayed it as a story about a doll entering the real world, but it surprisingly delves deeper into themes of feminism and patriarchy that were not adequately highlighted in the trailers. Had I not accidentally stumbled upon some spoilers before seeing the film, I would have been taken aback, expecting a more lighthearted and joyful adventure.Instead, \"Barbie\" turned out to be a story that explores the value of women and their place in society. While the central idea is commendable, the execution fell somewhat short for me. The plot became predictable once the main theme was revealed, and I could foresee the unfolding events and the movie\\'s conclusion.Undoubtedly, the movie\\'s core message is strong, but I couldn\\'t fully embrace its realization. I agree with the critics\\' observations regarding the one-dimensional portrayal of male characters and the lack of true equality in the ending, despite the intentions.Still, \"Barbie\" has several strengths. The visual style is captivating, and the beauty of Barbieland is truly enchanting. In addition, the actors deliver commendable performances that add depth to their characters.On the downside, some of the characters who are not dolls themselves seem a bit too childish in their behavior, which detracts from the overall balance. Also, the treatment of the Kens raised some concerns and left room for improvement.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" tackles an important and relevant issue, but it could have been executed more effectively. Despite its shortcomings, the movie manages to leave an emotional impact thanks to its captivating visuals and strong performances.', \"Words cannot express successfully how I feel about this movie. I want to first say how important this movie is for women in the industry. As a woman who's dream is to be a filmmaker and being so young this is a monumental achievement in my eyes. This movie has made me excited to see what younger minds can do. It has a wonderful creative voice and a beautiful mix of comedy and respectfully addresses hard topics in a way that I think everyone can benefit from. I can understand how some people find it preachy but I disagree because this is a love letter to women. There are so many things that stuck with me and I will probably remember forever. I am impressed with the amount or detail, creativity, and love that was so obviously put into this movie. Greta Gerwig and the rest of the production team did a beautiful job creating an immersive thought provoking experience that brought me to tears. This is by far Margot and Ryan's best performance I've seen and they deserve all the love for it. The sci-fi references are also a very interesting touch that I didn't expect. I think this is a movie than everyone can take something away from and it is very special to me.\", \"Not sure what to think about this movie but Margot Robbie is always great to watch and Ryan gosling is consistently great in all his movies these two definately ups my rating of the movie. Was left feeling a little bit underwhelmed! I might just watch it again because I'm sure I missed something in the plot the first time. The soundtrack is perfect for this very colourful film especially Billie eilish What was I made for and would be a shame if it didn't win an Oscar for best song at next years awards ceremony. Overall it was a pleasant watch but like all movies which are overhyped I wanted something more👍\", \"First, no actress on earth could have done this role other than Margot Robie. She's as if Barbie came to life (spoiler alert-she does). Margot is incredible in this. From the 2001 inspired opening (which had me laughing my head off) to when she's depressed and appears to be Barbie left behind by a little girl. The stiff legs, the arms, the way she rolls over-hysterical. The rest of the cast, especially America Ferrara, carry the story well and no one, no one is laughing at being in the movie. There are many, many Barbie related easter eggs, including one my wife pointed out to me: The interior of America's car is the same color as one of the original Barbie cars. The movie is fun without being preachy and if you pay attention-you may just learn something. One last thing, the great Dame Helen Mirren narrates! Go see it and have fun.\", \"The Barbie movie was overall highly enjoyable. The costumes and sets were great and added to the Barbie nostalgia. Ken was probably my favorite part, watching him go through the ups and downs of unrequited love, and finally finding himself outside of Barbie at the end of the movie. I even enjoyed the over-the-top portrayal of the patriarchy. It was hilarious. However, I felt the ending fell flat. Maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse, but I felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the Kens, to the point that it didn't feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all. It felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the Kens and laughing it off as funny. Sure, they gave them some minor administrative role at the end, but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong. Like it ended with the Barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women. Not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth. It happened as part of the finale. The final focus of the film. Overall, I highly enjoyed the movie, but the ending really made me leave feeling let down.\", \"This movie is nothing like I expected AND I LOVE IT. Greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama. I laughed, I almost cried and it was just the best experience.Having moments when I just loved seeing the interpretation of the Barbie world, moments that shocked me of how well they described the patriarchy even through jokes, the moments showing the women maturing and growing up that almost made me cry. There was nothing I didn't love about this movie and I can't stress this enough.Overall, this movie made me fell more empowered and confident than ever and I wish that everyone could have the same experience that I did.\", 'As far as I\\'m concerned, the first half of the movie was simply boring to me, and the attempts at humor on that level were just UGH. Yes, the message is fine, though very simplified - men bad, women good. I agree that equality is important, and I liked the conclusion that Kens need to find their own purpose. Of course, I didn\\'t miss the gay undertones with the Kens (flexing on the beach with beers and the Grease-like choreography where a black and yellow Ken give Gosling kisses on the cheeks and then shake it off with a \"what was that\" - I\\'d gladly pay a ticket for that action 😜), and there\\'s also a gay vibe with Allan and the cubicle guy from Mattel... I also liked Weird Barbie and Ruth. The Mattel board was a very coarse caricature to me.All in all, a \"mixed bag\" - there are good moments, but the bad ones outweigh them for me. I don\\'t regret watching it, but I wouldn\\'t do it again.It\\'s symptomatic to me that an Oppenheimer barely collects 650 million, and these guys double that, and it\\'ll probably be even more...\\nAnd that bit at the end with the gynecologist... I expected Barbie to get a job at Mattel as the new Ruth, but no: the message to the girls was to go to the gynecologist... facepalm....', \"I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie. Loved this movie.\", \"Barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes, challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist. The main standout truly is the costume design. Highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the Barbie concept. Borrowing elements from the Chanel's haute couture collection, to some of the rarest outfits from Barbie, it was such a unique experience to observe such understated works of art; even the extras/minor characters were wearing beautiful pieces. Some of the best costume design I've seen over the years.The plot was rather textbook, but definitely enjoyed the witty subtle jokes which created good tension and suspension. Well-balanced and great character development for most characters except for Sasha who changed opinions just too quickly for my taste.\", \"Barbenheimer? Who is the winner? Actually, when I though about it, their are two completely different movies. Both of them are great, I will tell you why this movie is great, but the main point is that you can't just compare this two movies. Anyway, Greta Gerwig did an absolutely amazing job, and I was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was. This is not made for kids, even if you could think this would be for kids, but no. Some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand.The good things about Barbie is the valuable moral itself. They show you that the world and humanity, isn't perfect, and it is never going to be perfect, you just have to focus on how you are now. They showed how women were treated in centuries, and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women, strong, reckless and to never show their feelings. That is something I wouldn't expect from this movie, I was very surprised, and the representation of men, Ken (Just Ken) as the main Ken played be Ryan Gosling, he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour.Margot Robbie was the second big star, or the first, both of them were amazing, but she played with such a feeling and emotion. When Barbie, the main Barbie played by Margot, discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect, and that not everyone are like her, she was completely off. Margot Robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in. Besides the actors, the storytelling, scenography and music soundtrack was amazing. Sometimes it was a bit too much screaming, but that's not the point, this movie was awesome!This is a movie for everyone. If you like Barbie, this movie is for you, if you don't like Barbie, this movie is for you. This is a movie made for everyone, everyone can enjoy it, and I can't really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden. This movie offers you so much moral, entertainment, and I think this was a great movie.\", 'Very entertaining, and fun. Does not take itself too seriously. Very good satirical acting. Props, and set building is very creative and in-depth. Ryan Gosling is great, and really funny. The plot and message are annoying though. Starts from the beginning with a very delusional message, and does not let up. Even though I tried to ignore the very delusional message throughout, the ending makes no sense. Barbie herself ends up not solving her problem, still being confused, and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie. That makes no sense whatsoever. The very last line of dialogue is a fail of a joke too. The director obviously did not know how to end the movie.', 'As I said at the beginning of the article, I lost my expectations before watching the movie because of the trailers. It felt like they were going on a story, especially one that would end up with big problems in the future. I will continue to watch an average movie when the analogies made on the internet seem to confirm my suspicions. But Barbie is hiding with a pretty well-written script. He uses drama in the parts that should be serious, and humor in the parts. From that moment on, the script can be both preserved and conveyed to the audience much better. Moreover, when the editing is at a fluent pace, you watch the movie breathlessly. The fact that its duration is under two hours is also nice considering the length of mainstream movies in recent years.', \"Good movie but nothing special. Good quality, funny and this all. After leaving the cinema, I had the feeling that I was watching a long corporate propaganda about Barbie. But that was probably it. Clearly Mattel wanted to improve the opinion of Barbie dolls based on feminist themes and the problem of gender inequality. However, there is a strong feeling that this topic was used as a marketing manipulation. Good cast and acting, film for both children and adults. Lots of references to barbie doll jokes. Margot Robbie played really great here, without her this movie would be much weaker.If you go to the cinema, you will probably be satisfied, but if you don't go, you won't lose anything. Strong 6.\", \"This film has certainly grabbed the headlines and produced some very positive reviews which encouraged us to see for ourselves. We were a little disapointed in the end. Whilst it was watchable and had it's humerous moments, we somehow expected more from it. It's very much in the mould of a Hollywood film with lots of obvious cliches. There were quite a few teenage girls in the cinema with their mothers, which could be the ones who enjoy this film the most. It's been described as a 'fun' film by many, which I can understand. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their parts well and add to the charm of the film. I would hesitate to recommend this, other than to youngsters or 'young at hearts' who love Barbie dolls and want see a fun film with lots of pink sparkle.\", '7.5/10\\nFirst of all, I really loved this movie. I think it\\'s fun and entertaining and I really think it\\'s done with a lot a passion for the original material. The references are clever and I couldn\\'t help but smile each time I saw a Barbie I had as a child (specially Midge!! I loved her). It\\'s a very colorful movie and it\\'s so refreshing to see that, specially with all the \"gray\" movies we get nowadays. The characters in Barbie land are fun and innocent, it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way it\\'s filmed, the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child. Plus I really loved Ken and I think Ryan Gosling did a great job, he was hilarious. The Kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for me.However this movie could have been an almost perfect movie if it wasn\\'t for the real world parts and the messaging at the end of the movie.First of all, the real world is extremely exaggerated and they were really pushing the political view they had in this part.The scene where a man simply smacks Barbie out of nowhere is very unnecessary and it ruins the beautiful parts were Barbie is trying to feel and understand the real world around her like with the old lady at the bus stop (that part is just perfect and captures the essence of the real and beautiful complexity of real world feelings). More so, the parts with the mother and the teenage daughter could have been way better and I really didn\\'t like them coming to the Barbie world. The \"deprogramming all the barbies\" was too forced for me and I would prefer if Barbie herself did that.Which leads me to the final part, the politics.After seeing the real world \\'patriarchy\", Ken, a character that lived his whole life just to please Barbie and is nothing more than an accessory to her, finally feels appreciated for the first time in his life and brings the patriarchy to his own world because of that. Is he right? No, of course not. But I think it was actually a logical thing for him to do in that moment. And, for me, the movie was going to acknowledge that at the end. But it didn\\'t. I mean, it did a little bit, but not enough in my opinion. It would have been awesome if the Barbies and kens came together at the end and decided to create a better society for both of them. But instead they chose to make a joke that \"the Kens will someday have just as much power as the women in the real world...\" It really missed the point of making Barbie land and lost the opportunity to make an inspiring example for the real world, one that helps the oppressed and makes equal opportunities for both men and women.Anyway, this my review of the movie and in conclusion: Close Kenough to a perfect movie.', 'It has its great moments like the « Barbie Bizarre » one but it is so jammed with pre-thought ideas that I never really took of. The jokes, the references seem to me pretty « cerebral » except the first one used in the trailer and some of Ryan Gosling ones when as a character he really go for it trying to be the one ! Otherwise, I felt pretty left outside of it as if in some kind of populist political meeting where all the ideas of the moment are expressed. Ok why not, but I came for a story with emotions... and some catharsis. Here I felt there were 4 attempts of making us have a catharsis... but none really worked for me. A cerebral mumble jumble.', \"Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you.\", \"This film is delightful, offering a perfect blend of colorful animation, engaging storytelling, and perfect scenes for audiences of all ages. They inspire creativity and encourage young viewers to embrace their individuality and dreams. The movies is truly a heartwarming and uplifting cinematic experience, I've entertained by watching it and it was truly an unforgettable experience. The storytelling was captivating, the performances were outstanding, and the cinematography was breathtaking. It's a must-see for anyone who appreciates great cinema. I can recommend it as an enough art and hope to see movies like this style next years.\", 'I loved the laughs that I got out of this movie! Being able to make fun of yourself makes life so much better! The movie was very meta and definitely knew what it was doing. The feel did give slight first season of the office vibes every now and then, but it hit the message home! The main actors In Barbie and Ken were exactly what the movie needed. Will Ferrell showing up was kinda weird not gonna lie, but he did fit into his \"bumbling idiot in charge of everything\" role perfectly. I would also love to see other men step up and say they enjoyed this movie. It was like sitting through a good roast. We should also listen to the true message, and make way for a more equal world. Even for the stereotypical Barbie\\'s, the weird Barbie\\'s, and every Barbie in between. On to Oppenheimer!', 'Wow is all I can say. So many layers that had my daughter and I smiling, laughing, and sobbing all at the same time. Absolute perfection. So brilliantly written. Everyone should see this movie. It was amazing!!! Aspects for generations of women to submerge themselves in and was also full of a beautiful nostalgia for all the little girls inside of us, and those still growing up. I can not say enough good things about this movie. Though some may not enjoy the truths behind what this movie stands for it was a true testament to our current state of the world and what weve had to deal with for forever. Again just absolutely brilliant.', 'The Barbie movie is an okay movie for kids and adults alike. The first half of the movie is somewhat engaging and entertaining. However, the later half of the movie after Barbieland is not as good as the first half. The story becomes less interesting and the characters are not as well developed. The cinematography is still great but the plot becomes predictable and less engaging. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Barbie and wants to see a fun and entertaining movie. If you are looking for a movie with a great story and characters, then you might be disappointed with the later half of the movie.', 'Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.As for the remaining 20%, it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose.', \"OMG IT IS SO GOOD especially for young woman! It is so inspiring and really shows everything Barbie is. I think this movie is good for all ages because it will teach all woman how life really is and it will teach young girls the reailty of this world and how to prepare for obstacles that come there way. This movie was funny as well as informing and I didn't expect this plot at all from this movie. I would see this again becuase it is just that good and I think out would needs to turn to Barbie land because there world is fair and I wish we could be like that. It is so amazing so so so good 5/5.\", \"This movie has an absurdist quality about it that I can't really explain, almost like early 2000's Ben Stiller movies like Zoolander or Tropic Thunder, that makes you feel as if you hallucinated the whole thing. In that regard, another comparison is Monty Python's flying circus and the sort of delightful wittiness of the show.Barbie is profoundly silly and strange and an extremely high effort production, reflected in the spectacular set design. Ryan Gosling is absolutely perfect for the role so much that he steals the show. The result is that Barbie is almost completely unlike anything else you would see at the cinemas.I don' t think the film is perfect or anything, the ending, for me, felt a bit unsatisfying for Ken, at least, and the film also contains a car commercial, for some reason. At the end of the day, even if you disagree or have problems with the feminist argument that the film makes, the film will have you smiling like an idiot most of the time in a way that not many other pieces of media can.\", \"While this movie is worth seeing and contains some humorous moments, as well as Ryan goslings 'I'm just Ken' being one of the highlights, I wasn't a fan of the men vs women portrayal, and the plot wasn't the best. For example, why did the Mattel board chase barbie into barbieland when what they wanted was for her to go back there and how did the Ken's brainwash intelligent barbies in such a short period of time. Also some of the references were a bit obscure and the end dragged on for at least 10 minutes too long. However it is worth noting that the costume and set design was astonishing and enhanced the experience of the movie.\", 'Me and my friend have been dying to see this film for months, we thought it would be a funny silly movie but its was so much more.There were so many emotional scenes that left me on the verge of tears the ending scene was honestly so incredibly emotional but it was amazing.Margot robbie was an amazing casting choice she played the role of barbie so fantastically, the casting choice for ken could have been better but honestly ryan gosling did amazing at his role aswell.Honestly this movie healed my inner child it was so amazing and i definitely recommend you go and see it because the movie actually is very funny but you probably will end up tearing up at some point.', \"Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.\", 'I loved the set design, acting and personal development of the characters, the nuance and meaning, but didn\\'t like the rushed storyline. Production obviously invested a great deal in the set design, barbie dream houses, and wardrobes. It was pink everything with blue \"beach\", with a plastic vibe. It was cool how they incorporated the Barbie box and different outfits, something I loved as a child. I also thought TV Barbie was a blast from the past (90s baby here), and learned about other dolls like Midge, Skipper, and Alan. Also... they didn\\'t do poor Midge any justice. She was played by a terrific actress, so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character. I thought Alan was played very well though.I thought that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling played their characters perfectly, capturing their characters development and different nuances. You could definitely see Barbies transformation into a human, but Margot did a good job at keeping Barbie at her core even in human form.Some of my favorite storylines included the war of the Kens, the discovery of patriarchy, the brainwashing of the Barbies, and the takeover of the Barbies - again.However, the switch to the real world and back felt rushed, as well as the relationship development between Sasha and Gloria, and Barbie. Really what should have happened was a two part movie, to fully tell the story, or a 3 hour movie. I also felt they spent too much time in Barbie world in the beginning and felt myself getting bored.For example, Sasha and Gloria meet Barbie and after one scene believe that she is a doll and follow her back to Barbie world. I felt like Barbie should have had to work to make them believe her, making the discovery of Barbie world by Sasha and Gloria even sweeter, and Barbie\\'s transformation into human even more complex. I wish I got to see her learn more about becoming human. I absolutely loved the gynecologist scene at the end, but felt that could have been earlier in the movie, with the scene with Ruth at the end.I couldn\\'t discern if this movie was just a comedy or trying to be serious, with all the complex nuance surrounding feminism. It could have easily been both if there was more time spent on Barbie\\'s transformation to human. Maybe a second movie could have been about her going back to Barbie world in human form to save her girls and restore the proper control to Barbie.', 'I\\'m a childfree woman that works in tech (male dominated environments), and I did not like this movie.The first third of the movie was awesome! I loved seeing girls destroying their baby dolls and replacing with Barbie. As a childfree woman I was so excited!The movie could have spent time exploring Barbie Dreamland, or time showing Barbie and Ken reacting to stuff in the real world... instead they:1) Delivered rants about \"the patriarchy\", the movie was preachy and for what? Anyone at the Barbie movie is already open minded enough to go see this movie2) Made it about \"men vs women\" rather than equality. A lot of issues women face due to social expectations affect men too, and feminism isn\\'t about a matriarchy it\\'s about equality3) It wanted to deliver social commentary while being lazy. Even Ken says \"I thought the patriarchy was about horses\" If a movie wants to address social issues using terms as buzz words isn\\'t enough. They could have explored how the patriarchy affects both genders, but this movie imo just wanted to virtue signal4) They got a diverse cast, yet only the white actors had depth5) At the end of the movie Barbie has visions of moms and daughters as the reason it\\'s worth being human. A complete opposite message to the girls destroying their baby dolls at the beginning of the movieI went into Barbie hoping for a ridiculous movie, not a movie about \"how tough it is to be a woman\"10/10 to the marketing team, though. They made me think this movie would be fun.', 'Things I didn\\'t like:\\nThe over the board marketing and publicity (esp about the IP products)\\nLack of subtlety.Feels too preachy at some points.The Mattel scenes were little too silly.Like:\\nSatire hits hard most of the time.Unapologetic and audacious approach.A Strong message and way it is delivered.The mother-daughter dynamics (at most times).Production design and color pallets.Margot Robbie and our guy Ryan almost perfectly playing their parts.Greta Gerwig\\'s direction.Now onto some spoiler-y bit:I think most people just want to gets triggered without putting much thought behind this. They missed the main point.We have to remember that it is a satire and both the Barbie Land and Real World are extreme representations of polarity which is not what we need. I think it does well to deliver the message of why individuality is more important.Also I support how at the end how they didn\\'t just give the Kens the equal status in the councils or whatever because at the end of the day at that very moment, in that fictional world the Barbies were more qualified (by design) to hold those positions and all the Kens have just been are side characters with no \"real\" talents other than being the eye candys to the Barbies. Upliftment on basis of gender and not merit/talent is never a sign of a healthy society . But from now onwards it will not be \"Barbie...and Ken\" but \"it\\'s Barbie and it\\'s Ken\". I think this was the first step towards that balanced and independent world.3.5/5 + 0.5 stars for the sheer audacity to bring forth such a daring topic at such a scale. It will be a 3rd/4th in my list of Greta Gerwig\\'s work.', \"6 only for the jokes, the movie Is really stupid, not for Kids and not Easy undestand with dialogs\\nPuts a lot of thing together Just to seems fair in gender equality in the worst way that you can Imagine.You can seen the movie and find It funny, it's ok, because without that there'll not be a movie\\nNothing to tell\\nSomething old to compare to today's Life\\nWill Farrell more idioti then ever\\nAmerica Ferrera daughter uselles speach about fascism, capitalism and uselles the history\\nAmerica Ferrera idea of a new And already seenIs a brunch of nothing out together, nothing to Remember instead of the funny jokes.\", \"The social commentary was pretty heavy-handed. Albeit, this is to be expected in the Barbie movie. However, it was genuinely funny. A lot of creativity and imagination went into this movie which ads to the charm. There were tons of little details that could make this a movie great to own and watch more than once. Plot was a cute but could have been smarter. Its nice to see a new movie that isn't just a remake or a sequel but I fully expect to see a franchise for this. I appreciated the few times that they seemingly poked fun at feminism. In one the of the final scenes, the creator of barbie character said that the patriarchy was something that was made up to deal with how the world is.\", 'Yikes if this movie offends you! 😂 I loved all the characters, the instructions and montages of how to get to the real world, the mom/daughter storyline, the depression ad lol, weird barbie, the horses, the physical comedy (showering, going down a slide), and great use of a really good Matchbox 20 song. 😂😂 Margot and Ryan are such standouts in this and the costumes are amazing. This movie is an instant classic! Such iconic moments and ideas. It is perfectly placed in 2023 and will be talked about for ages. Congrats to Greta and her team for achieving such an amazing box office opening weekend.', \"Funny thing to say about a Barbie movie, means I had my hopes too up, but it's more about who directed it, I think she's pretty good.What worked for me was the barbie world, and Margot and especially Ryan were great. Every scene with Ryan was great, he's got great comedic timing.What didn't work was the real world. The real people are supposed to come and teach the dolls what real life is like, but they do it with the most cliche, cringiest dialogue (I would call it womansplaining honestly, stuff that will make everyone cringe in like 10 years - but hey, it's a Barbie movie in 2023, what can you expect).The issue really is that the real people (the mother and daughter and the Mattel people and even people on the streets) were just not believable as real people. So if you're not going to show believable characters, you may as well just show me the dolls and remove the real world all together.Overall pretty funny, worth a watch, but it has much less depth than I imagined from the trailers. In the end it's just a huge product placement, when it could've been more. But hey, just imagine how them profits will skyrocket.\", \"Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie\\nJohn Cena and America Ferrera deliver hilarious performances\\nThe movie tackles feminism and patriarchy in a funny and unsubtle way.Barbie movie is an inventive comedy that works both as a love letter and deconstruction of Barbie as a concept\\nThe movie is fun, creative, and goes in unexpected directions\\nIt has clever messages about manhood and redemption\\nKen's character is redeemed and Barbie apologizes to him for ignoring him before\\nThe movie portrays how isolating manhood can be and ends with the Ken's finding fulfillment in being their own people\\nThe song 'I'm just Ken' is catchy and perfectly integrated into the final battle.Barbie is a movie that explores the struggles and joy of womanhood\\nClick to collapse\\nSeek out female perspectives on this movie to understand its message about womanhood\\nThe movie is extremely funny, well-directed, and has wonderful sets and costumes.\", \"Barbie is a film that stands out in many aspects, from its comedic moments to its unique charm. The world it presents is filled with vibrant colors, whimsical settings, lively music, and a sense of fantasy and extravagance. Visually speaking, the film is truly unmatched. The actors delivered commendable performances, with special applause going to Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. However, I must admit that I personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film. They struck me as particularly funny.Where the story loses points is in its confusing message. While the film clearly aims to promote gender equality, the way it delivers this message suggests a certain superiority of the female gender. Some of the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic within the narrative. It wasn't so much the fact that the pep talks were about women, but rather the way they were integrated into the story. I want to clarify that my criticisms are not driven by bigotry or sexism. As a woman myself, I appreciate the intention but felt it could have been handled more subtly.I found it disappointing that many of the characters in the film, such as Alan and several of the Barbies/Kens, lacked relevance and development or were straight up stereotypes. Additionally, I would have liked to see more exploration of Barbie Land and its unique characteristics. On a positive note, the message about the transient nature of one's life in comparison to the enduring power of an idea was sweet and exciting.\", \"This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.But other than that this movie was enjoyable, maybe not one of my favourites and I might not watch it again, but seeing it in the cinema was such a great atmosphere and it was fun to see everyone dress up and have fun and laugh together! <3.\", \"I was super excited for the movie since the day they announced it and I've been looking forward to it. I was ready with my pink shirt, popcorn and tickets to the early screening expecting a fun loving and very pink movie.And it sure was a very pink and fun loving movie, but I was not expecting the turn it took. It made me go through so many emotions I wasn't expecting to feel, twist and turns that made me laugh, moments that made me cry and the ending was fantastic to say the least.The Barbie Movie is everything I was expecting and so much more, I think the highlight, other than the amazing message, casting and storytelling, was when John Cena appeared.In summary, I'm not the same person I was 1h and 54m ago.\", \"This movie was worth going to the theater I thought it was a good idea and there ware some really good jokes haw ever there are a few holes in the story and I feel like Barbie's personality was very empty I know that that is kind of how it's supposed to be because Barbie is a dal but for me I need to have a memorable mane characters. A other thing I liked about the movie was the opening scene lats just say it MIGHT BE\\nReally FUNNY. There were a lot of scenes in this were the hole theater was lagging so loud l couldn't hear a thing. I also never played with barbies so I didn't get any of the references but yeah I think movie was decent.\", 'Opposite of my expectations, overall I thought this movie was entertaining and pretty funny. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as Ken and the Ken\\'s as a whole were really funny and my favorite part about the movie. The set design was knocked out of the park, it was the perfect look of Barbie land and it really immersed you in it. Lastly I thought the little details in the movie were awesome, like as if somebody was playing with Barbie like when she floats down from her house, the shower water is imaginary, and the drink she has at breakfast is imaginary. I love little details like that and Gerwig killed it with those.But just like everyone has been talking about, I\\'d like to talk about the \"message\" this movie is pushing. I overall didn\\'t feel like they were straight \"man hating\", but there definitely were certain parts where you just roll your eyes but it didn\\'t take away from the overall experience for me. The part where they go to the real world and every dude they encounter is a cat calling misogynistic a-hole was a bit much for me, I am obviously aware it happens in the real world but they exaggerated it quite a bit. Imagine you take your young daughter to see this, it\\'s gonna make her think every dude she encounters going forward is an a hole growing up.The Characters of America Ferrera\\'s daughter and the Mattel higher up\\'s were absolutely worthless to the plot. I mean she is introduced to us by honestly being a b**** to Barbie spewing adult themed nonsense and then after that really has no growth and just is along for the \"diversion/twist\" that her mom is the one that needed Barbie\\'s help.My main gripe with this movie is the plot of the last 30 minutes and the ending. Ken comes back from Earth with \"Patriarchal\" ideals and takes over Barbie land and I honestly couldn\\'t tell if they were supposed to be the so on \"villains\" of the movie or if just it was a joking way to have a problem in the movie. Because I never really felt like they were bad guys, Ken was treated like crap by Barbie and so it makes it really hard to ever root against him. The end was just real clunky and stuff just happened so fast and got too serious too fast. It\\'s like they did it just they could get a way to fit in that montage video to pull women\\'s emotional strings.PSA: This is not a kids movie, definitely intended for young adults to middle aged women. Most of the humor in it is adult level humor.But overall I came into this movie thinking I would dread it but came out happy with my experience watching it.', \"This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected. Mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off; kudos to the believers of this script. It is so worth seeing once, twice, three times and then some!\", 'I\\'m only writing this due to the misperception of this movie. I saw the movie opening night with my GF who loved and still loves Barbie. She is stereotypical Barbie and she dressed up in pink and had a wonderful time. If you\\'re a fan of Barbie you can stop reading here and just go see the movie you will love it.In fact if you are a fan of Barbie I suggest you stop reading this review and allow yourself to enjoy the fantasy and childhood nostalgia the movie will surely provide and avoid discussing the movie with anyone who wants to dissect it or take away from your feel good experience.However, for the people who are championing the movie as a feminist masterpiece or hating on it for its depiction of men, I would like to ask if you watched the same movie? Neither men nor women were the target in this movie. This movie was taking shots at beautiful and desirable people in general. It is established quite early on that the Barbie\\'s and Kens live in a dreamland and falsely believe they have solved the worlds problems and live in blissful ignorance. As soon as this main charachters bliss is threatened, that becomes the problem that the movie focuses on needing to be solved. Even though many real world problems are addressed and pointed out (usually by people not good looking enough to live in barbieland), they are all ignored and left unresolved by the end of the movie, that is, aside from the inclusion of \"ordinary people\" by Mattels introduction of \"Ordinary Barbie\", which seems to serve as further evidence of Mattel claiming self awareness (hammered home by constant self deprecation while never actually crossing the line into actually being the antagonist of the film) and wanting to distance itself from their objectification of women by making Barbie in the first place. Finally Barbie did not get any character growth by becoming real, Mattel just placed her in a box and got her off the production line through manipulative means employed by the founder of Mattel - an old woman. (honestly ladies, this is your real enemy in life lol. Men are pretty useless as depicted, old women who hate you for being young and shitty men who cant have you are the ones who oppress you)The movie however seemed to say these things through mockery:\\n1- if you treat men like the Barbies treat the Kens, you will become one option of many, as made clear by being labelled low commitment casual girlfriends.2 - When your old (like Barbie) you have to leave barbyland and you will be immediately devalued by having to relinquish access to your vagina. HOWEVER even though Ken is old (and unbelievably dumb and useless) he still gets to live in Barby Dreamland and maintains access to all the young beautiful Barby\\'s which just seems to reinforce the supposedly \"patriarchal\" concept of men maintaining value as partners far longer then women.3 - If you\\'re young and pretty (for women) or just pretty (for men), you dont have any real problems and get to focus solely on easing any perceived blows to your extremely fragile emotional state while all the ugly people in the real world maintain order and functionality while dealing with \"real problems\".4 - There in fact is a special existence for people who are good looking enough to qualify and even though its not based in reality, as long as your good enough, you get to live in the perfect dreamland while ugly people live in reality.That being said, the movie is done very well and fun to watch and the casting is done well with all criticisms of the cast being too old, being proven wrong as their age was the actual focal point of the movie. Aside from America Ferrara. We do not like her as an audience lol. Superstore proved this. Her patronizing speech is an insult to women\\'s intellects and the low point of the movie. Gosling\\'s accidently but surprisingly meta self portrayal is probably the highlight. (I dont understand why men are upset by this, how Gosling was portrayed in this movie is exactly how I have seen him my entire life lol..).I\\'d rate Barby as Sublime.', '\"Barbie,\" the new movie with a mission to encourage and empower women while challenging the notion of Barbie\\'s objectification, falls short of its ambitious goals due to its overwhelmingly negative portrayal of men and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. While the film\\'s attempt to address social issues and promote self-confidence among girls is commendable, its approach feels one-sided and counterproductive.On the positive side, \"Barbie\" does boast an impressive musical score that complements the storyline effectively. The movie\\'s soundtrack adds a touch of vibrancy and energy, helping to alleviate some of the weight of its problematic themes. Bilie Eilish\\'s song, \"What was i made for\" sang by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling performance in \"I\\'m just Ken\" are the standouts.Unfortunately, the film takes a heavy-handed approach in addressing gender issues. Instead of promoting a message of unity and understanding, \"Barbie\" seems to place the blame for all the problems in the world solely on men and the patriarchy. Such a narrative fosters a divisive atmosphere and fails to acknowledge the importance of cooperation between genders to achieve true progress.The portrayal of men in the movie is disappointing and paints them with an unfairly broad brush. By portraying all male characters as either stupid, childish, immature, or disrespectful towards women, the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes, alienating a significant portion of its potential audience, including male viewers and responsible male role models.Additionally, the excessive focus on harassment, groping, and dirty looks that Barbie experiences when she enters the real world feels gratuitous and does not contribute constructively to the movie\\'s message. Instead of presenting a nuanced and realistic exploration of gender dynamics, it leans heavily on extreme examples, potentially distancing audiences from the central themes the film is attempting to address.', \"Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline. Cast was star-studded and everything seemed to be in place, nothing off there. However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt.\", \"If you want to educate yourself on patriarchy, read Virginia Woolf. The creation or viewing of this movie are horrible ways to raise your awareness about women's rights. It feels like writers were out of ideas an hour into the movie. The movie tries to have some sense of humor but hurts the main idea more than defending it while trying to make jokes about stereotypes of today.The movie features musical type scenes but both the songs and dancing is horrible. People discuss if barbie products inspire girls or force a certain body type to them, so disappointing them but no worries, this movie can inspire nor deceive no one. Even the director lost inspiration half way through.\", 'Barbie was honestly a pleasant surprise, I went as a joke thinking it would be stupid but ended up loving the movie. The acting and humour were perfect and everything was so well done. The storyline was incredibly good for a movie about dolls and I am honestly impressed. The soundtrack was great and the songs sung were even better. The effects and sets were perfect for the theme and plot and it just worked so well. I absolutely loved it and hope it does well at the box office because it deserves so many awards. Margot Robbie, great. Ryan Gosling, amazing. Michael Cera, better than ever. Will ferrel, yes! John Cena, best character. Great movie everyone should watch!!!', 'I would probably feel more positive about the film if it hadn\\'t been hyped up so much in the marketing and press junkets.The first half of the film is essentially the trailer and the second half doesn\\'t deliver anything profound. I was disappointed the conversation on femininity and what it means to be a woman didn\\'t develop past what is already in pop culture. Yes we know there are high standards for beauty.The second half of the film becomes a mess, with the meaning that they\\'d set up in the first part of the film falling apart. The scene dedicated to breaking up with Ken was plain confusing to me, the part where she becomes a human even more so and then the gynaecologist appointment ugh. I probably needed to have a very different sense of humour to watch this film (despite the fact I find Ryan Gosling hilarious in other things)I got the to the end thinking \"is that it?\"', \"This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that. It's a lot though. Just a lot going on, and not all of what was going on was necessary.Also, Ryan Gosling is not the best singer or dancer. It was cheesy and over the top. I'm glad I saw it in theaters because if it was on a streaming service I'd probably turn it off as it was so weird. It's worth watching so you're in on the hype and pop culture reference this will surely become.\", 'It was a literal cinematic master piece. It was comedic, touching, educational, ground breaking.It touches upon feminism, misogyny, patriarchy, women\\'s relationship with themselves.It showed a utopia run by women, Barbie land wasn\\'t perfect, the kens were ignored but not hated, undervalued but not sexualized.In a world meant to mirror patriarchy, we saw a difference in treatment that really opened people\\'s eyes.It also highlighted how the patriarchy is toxic to all involved including men, it touched on the lack of emotional intelligence men have, it highlighted toxic masculinity and overall critique of how men and women have been interacting with each other since the beginning of time.The hardest thing about watching this movie is knowing that there will be a group of people who interpret this as \"hate\" when it couldn\\'t be further from the truth and the audience who rejects the messages this film shows are the group of people who need this education the most.The best part of this movie was seeing women of all ages come to the movie theater to laugh, cry and wake up mentally, together.Overall this movie shows the struggle of women and girlhood in a patriarchal society and how it not only demeans women but strips men of their validity, forcing men to grow up disconnected from their emotions and experiences of others and how important it is to bridge the gap between genders to create a BETTER world not just for women but for men as well.This film is truly for everyone and powerful enough to change the trajectory of society. Fantastic film.', 'Barbie is Gerwig-Lite: just far too self-aware for its own good, to the point where it feels like it was written explicitly to impress critics. Gerwig and Baumbach parrot out every single intersectional feminist talking point in the book in an effort to communicate to the audience, \"Hey, we\\'re aware of the philosophical complexities of this issue but we\\'re still having fun!\" Which, fine, but Gerwig has already probed the question of what it means to be a woman much more meaningfully in her previous films without the kind of extratextual baggage this resorts to; political astuteness doesn\\'t make for very entertaining or memorable film dialogue. Also, long for the (often hinted-at) version of this movie that critiques the toxicity and shortcomings of corporate feminism instead of basically endorsing it wholeheartedly (although I guess the ending sort of posits it as \"not for everyone\" but again, you see my point as to how overwritten this is). The production design and costumes are colorful and intricate but feel too safe, the soundtrack is rife with bland focus-group pop, and the whole thing has that weird plasticky look and feel to it that all Hollywood movies post-COVID seem to have. (I suppose \"plastic\" is appropriate for a movie about America\\'s favorite doll, but I watched some of The Thin Red Line after getting home from the theater and felt myself ache for a time when humans wrre able to make beautiful-looking movies). It\\'s indeed as fun and cute and peppy as everyone\\'s said it is, but it could have been so much more.Major points deducted for uncalled-for digs at Pavement and The Godfather (plenty of women love both!!)', 'I went to this movie without watching previews or expecting anything. This movie turned out to be everything a Barbie-loving thirty-something needed twenty years ago. Expertly cast, the Barbie movie is hilariously self-aware and has no dull moments. Though the Micheal is obviously mainly about Barbie, Ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplot.The movie was beautiful visually and funny from beginning to end. The attention to detail was clear and the storyline had the theater crying happy tears by the end. Definitely see it if you are a parent and take your parent friends with you. Make sure you wear pink ;)We would see it again and again!', 'It has great moments. The beginning might be the strongest I\\'ve ever seen. Unique. The soundtrack has a few songs that fall flat but overall it was very strong. Cinematography was unreal. Calling the old woman beautiful was rare and cool. The writing does seem to break down eventually though like really dropping the ball articulating the themes at times. Its not \"dark, weird, and crazy\" to have thoughts about death. That was just a strange choice. Margot Robbie had the best performance by far.I really think the movie aims for a message of equality so its kinda contradictory that the resolution in barbieland is a woman-run government. I get what they\\'re doing. I get its not a real place. But then why make a joke about letting the men have a few seats in the lower courts, when four women sit on the supreme court today. Joke about them just not being able to be president or something if you want it to hit home.I think when people call this movie \"preachy\" theyre mostly talking about America Ferrera\\'s speech. A lot of the points are valid but idk about:\"And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing\\neverything wrong, but also everything is your fault.\"\"never fall down, never fail, never show fear\"Maybe in finance bro world? I still think the movie is well-intentioned. You should and they do preach equality.I think legally blonde handled the same message better. You see people not taking her seriously throughout. It felt more developed like yes all these things are disadvantages that should change but you\\'re already overcoming them while not shedding any femininity you may enjoy.', \"This film quickly loses the plot and so do you. I feel like the writers decided to put EVERYTHING in it and address EVERY audience. Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) does it successfully. So does The Matrix (1999) and when it comes to visiting parallel worlds, or escapism, Beauties of the Night (1952) or even Alice in Wonderland (1951) are far better. Paroles, paroles, paroles, that's what Barbie's all about. Actually everything in this movie sounds old, tired and stale. People Will Talk (1951) still sounds fresh comparing to this. Or Kiss and Make Up (1934) that also deals with male-female relationships and beauty standards.Some of the films about empowerment and diversity that beat Barbie on every possible level are: The Iron Jawed Angels (2004), Million Dollar Baby (2004), Boys Don't Cry (1999), Amelia (2009), Amélie (2001), Little Miss Sunshine (2006), The Heiress (1949), Mildred Pierce (1945), Kitty Foyle (1940), Ninotchka (1939), 9 to 5 (1980), Working Girl (1988), Precious (2009), The Color Purple (1985), Hairspray (1988), My Beautiful Laundrette (1985), Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), The First Wives Club (1997), Alien (1979), Halloween (1978), Trading Places (1988) and the list goes on. Hilary Swank is in four of them, so give that girl an extra cookie! Also, all of Katharine Hepburn, Glenda Jackson, Bettie Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Mae West, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford films exude empowerment. You don't have to figure it out, it will simply posses you.The visuals in Barbie seem AI. I'm not a fan of digital effects so maybe that's why I wasn't impress. I grew up watching Classic Hollywood musicals. The choreography, the dancing & singing skills, the costumes and all of that in Technicolor or in beautiful black and white was so much more effective than this. All That Jazz (1979), American in Paris (1951), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), The Red Shoes (1948), Lady in the Dark (1944), all of Fred & Ginger films and those choreographed by Busby Berkeley are far more spectacular and better produced than Barbie.The characters are not sympathetic to me and the cathartic moment in the film when Barbie achieves her humanity by discarding Ken is also the moment when I don't care what she does. The movie has already been too long, there has already been a lot of senseless running around, in and out of Barbieland, like watching too many episodes of the latest Turkish soap opera with your mum, the drama, the subversion, the subversion of the subversion, the flat feet, the cellulite, the arrest, the chase with the men in black, the meeting with your maker... I wouldn't care if the two of them ended up going on a holiday with Slavoj Zizek. Though, that would be something. So, in conclusion, if you want to see a heartwarming movie about a doll that becomes human, I recommend Pinocchio (1940).\", 'Hilarious, fun, poignant, smart, and satirical. As a middle-aged mother of 4, I related to Gloria SO MUCH. And I cried. Boy did I cry. Much like Everyone Everywhere All At Once, I felt SEEN. For all the critics of the movie, my response is, 1. (Quoting Jack Nicholson) YOU CAN\\'T HANDLE THE TRUTH, and 2. ITS SATIRE, FOLKS! But like most satire, it flies over the heads of many. Many stereotypes are addressed in an obvious way, but others are subtle. Not going because you don\\'t want to support what you\\'ve heard is a political \"side\", well, that\\'s just ridiculous. Give yourself more credit than that.', \"The movie started out fun and strong. I agree with some of the other reviews on here that the cast was excellent, set design superb, etc. However, the plot needed more clarity and to choose a better direction.What I liked: It emphasized how with Barbie/dolls girls get to imagine themselves becoming all the things they can imagine and in their worlds they can control everything. Unfortunately, in the real world, patriarchy exists and we're limited. I liked it didn't marry Barbie off to Ken or make her have to have a relationship to be happy.What I didn't like: The stereotypical treatment of men and the relegation of them back to second class citizens in Barbie land. That things got confusing and hard to follow. Why exactly were all Barbies instantly brainwashed but stereotypical Barbie?I wish they could have handled the gender issues in a way to enforce more equality between the Kens and the Barbies without necessarily marrying them all of in pairs. Maybe Ken finally does get his mojo dojo saloon just not by taking over Barbies dream house. He gets acknowledged and gets his space too. Maybe he hooks up with Midge because he moves on. Maybe he gets a beach house so he can Beach off whenever he wants. I don't know. It was funny. I laughed out loud several times. Glad I saw it. Just wish they went some different directions.\", \"Starting off exciting and upbeat the movie quickly spirals into endless monologues about the patriarchy.Occassionally there's upbeat dance scenes with Ken(Ryan Gosling) spread throughout the movie.With a strong posse of neo-feminist activists leading the war effort against the dumb Ken's - Kate McKinnon leads well.Michael Cera and Will Ferrell are in their least funny roles ever.Margot Robbie plays well, as well as I expected the movie to be but the movie is mostly negative, I could deal with alot of it in good spirit, but the flogging was extensive and I'm all beat up now. Will never watch this movie again - it's terrible.\", 'I found it to be a surprising grand piece of comedic, satire story telling, again concerning questions of gender roles and toxic masculinity. By the end I was moved to tears for Barbie AND Ken. It represented to me many issues of modern times and things I was confronted with in real life. The candy pop world and performances added so much to it to support the story and as a set designer I found the Barbieworld of course mesmerizing, melancholic and so well done. I hope, apart from all the social media hype, it will do some good in the world, heals girls, women, boys and men... and all those men who got dragged by their girlfriends and found it a reminder we dont need the other gender to support our worth. It is and was the hardest lesson to learn.... for me.', \"I was super excited to see this movie but I'm coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed. The marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what I expect and so my expectations were very high. There were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message. I think this film is a little late, maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesn't add much value to the feminist cause. It's worth seeing as it's definitely of cultural interest, but I won't be rewatching it.\", \"The movie is fun, silly, and entertaining. Saw this in the theater which is the first time I've been in one since 2020 most people including myself for dressed up. Everyone interacted with the movie by cheering and clapping throughout. After the movie was over everyone was so uplifted that chatting in the lobby was actually a thing between strangers. That's a lot to get from a little movie about a small doll. I told my husband on the way home we will have to find a karaoke version of a song that Ken sings but not necessarily the one that Barbie does. Will Ferrell was unexpected and as always completely enjoyable.\", \"Most movie buffs have hated modern trailers for quite some time now. It's annoying that it often has to contain such an epic version of an existing pop song, but the worst thing is that they often show the entire film in short - and then also exactly as it goes in the film. The creators of Barbie understood that the first half hour contains enough material to use only its footage to capture the audience's interest. What follows next is a wonderful surprise.Barbie is a mirror to a major problem in society that many people don't even see in its entirety because it's so deeply ingrained.Thanks.\", \"At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés.\", \"A word of advice. Don't waste your money and time going to see the Barbie movie. Went with the whole family (including my 12 year old daughter and wife) and they asked to leave before it was over, it was that bad. I think it's been 30 years since I walked out of a movie theater because the movie was so, so bad. I don't know how it's been so successful. Marketing at its best (or worst). It's boring, disjointed, and sexist (to both men and women). It's an unwatchable mess, and by the last 20 minutes we cared so little about the characters, that we just left. It's horrendous. Save two hours of your life and don't bother watching.\", \"Outstanding cast that tried to save a shortsighted and predictable storyline. Gosling once again shows that he's in a class of his own. Barbie started out fun but shortly into the film, the vibe changes and things take a turn for the worse. The room changes from lighthearted laughter, excitement, and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily. Our fun and bubbly Barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche, hashed-out stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman. Sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from Ryan Gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well. Seems like whoever made this movie had issues that they wanted us all to deal with instead of telling us a great story.\", \"Barbie was an incredible movie and experience. There was a perfect balance between the replication of our own childhood experiences with the dolls, and the introduction of the hopeful changes for the current state of the world. The way the movie made our little imaginations come to life on the big screen was magical. It was great to see a movie about barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll , being so inclusive and aware of issues we still have today. It was emotional, funny, and a breath of fresh air. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the rest of the cast... just bravo. It was truly so wonderful & I can't wait to watch it again.\", 'Film Barbie was directed by Greta Gerwig. It stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. The film is set in Barbie Land and Real World. It was filmed mostly in UK. The story starts in our time in Barbie Land. One day her feet are getting flat and she goes to Weird Barbie for advice,she sends her to the Real World. Ken hides in the car and goes with Barbie. There Barbie founds out very upset things,but Ken the exact opposite. He brings his knowledge of patriarchy into Barbie land and everything goes upside down. In the end Barbies and Alan save Barbie Land.I strongly recommend Barbie. It shows very important things ,has wonderful soundtracks. I really loved this film.', \"The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.I'm a visual kind of cinema goer and I have the say that dance sequence (Dance the Night) and the scene where Barbie and Ken where traveling to the real world were AMAZING. Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart.\", \"I was literally praying to be struck dead so I didn't have to see one more second of this film. Even Margot Robbie couldn't save this over hyped trash. I could feel my IQ drop each minute of the movie that went by. I was amazed, shocked and in horror to see that there were actually people on IMDB none the less who thought this film was ::gasp:: good? Not even close, waste of my time and a waste of my life which I can never get back.I'll admit I did laugh at one point however I am not sure if this was due to my sanity slowly slipping away or my braincells seeping from my ear drums. If you hate your life and just want to waste what precious time you have on earth, this is the movie for you.\", 'Wish I could give Barbie 11 stars! I haven\\'t had this much fun at the movies in a very long time! In fact, I\\'ve already seen it FOUR times and if I can find another friend who hasn\\'t seen it yet, I\\'ll go again!There is music and dancing and laughter and even a couple tears. The dialogue is often surprising. And yes, it packs a beautiful message, too. This movie has it all! Margot Robbie is the perfect \"stereotypical Barbie\" and Ryan Gosling is absolutely hilarious as Ken. But really the entire cast is terrific. I especially loved the inclusion of weird Barbie and Allen.Some seem to think it\\'s anti-men. No way! It is anti-patriarchy, but that\\'s not the same thing. If you haven\\'t seen it, go now! If you have seen it, go again!', \"I'm not sure what the writers and director are trying to say with this film, but I'm certain that it is 100% a vehicle to sell all the iterations of the boys' and girls' dolls and all their accessories.It doesn't paint the manufacturer in a good light, making the CEO (Ferrell, whom I heartily dislike anyway) a buffoon, along with all the men who occupy the boardroom.It makes several well-placed jabs at patriarchy, and the real world, but seems disjointed and searching for a meaningful plot. I swear, this is the last Gerwig movie I will subject myself to, because I find all of her films to date to be confusing and pointless.The two leads (Robbie and Gosling) are perfect, as is the rest of the cast, especially Kate McKinnon as the weird doll. (I refuse to write the names of the manufacturer or the dolls as my own little protest of blatant consumerism and marketing to children.) Just once, I'd like to watch a film directed toward children that doesn't include superheros, blowing up things, violence, or product placement.\", 'Got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I\\'m glad that I did. Here is my review written as a prententious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig\\'s latest directorial venture, \"Barbie,\" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unraveling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig\\'s live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie\\'s role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I\\'m giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.', 'I entered the cinema with high expectations, and they were massively outdone. The movie unfolds in a humorous manner, as lovable characters evolve in the most beautiful way they could. Margot Robbie is truly outstanding, and as a spectator I fully lived the experience thanks to her incontestable talent. As the experiences slowly unwrap, the issues and feelings that are contoured cut deeper and deeper, and the audience gets to experience these emotions in a sincere, beautiful way.The movie is about the simplicity and complexity of life, about humans and their emotions, about what we do and why we do it, and about how they all meet in a fulfilling and imperfectly beautiful point.', 'It was sooo boring, I could have left in the middle of the film and not care less about what was happening to the characters. I love the cast but everything was soo unfunny. I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is \"The Barbie\" isn\\'t so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator. I Love Greta but it dosen\\'t feel like her. Kinda like with Wednesday not feeling like a Tim Burton thing. But good job with the marketing, it got me.', \"I swear to god this movie is one of the best i've seen this year. My expectations were high BUT NOT THAT HIGH. I'm not sure if this movie is good for small kids, they may not understand the problems this film addresses. I'm really happy that this movie was created because we should talk more about this problem (I don't wanna say what is this problem coz it would be a spoiler and i want you guys to have a surprise). And seeing Ryan Gosling in this role is something i would never expect to see. We know Ryan from all those mysterious and dark action films so seeing him dancing in colorful clothes and doing all these crazy stuff is incredible. I love this man and I love him even more now, i'm so grateful that he took part in such a great project that addresses such a huge problems. If you're still wondering if you should go or not the answer is YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO.\", \"I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away. Under the guise of Barbie's beautiful dreamworld, the movie touches on some very real themes. With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time. I highly recommend for everyone to watch!\", \"This movie was a pleseant surprise. It managed to strike an excellent balance between adult and child themes, and essentially all of the humor lands well.Towards the end it gets a little preachy with a certain character's speech, which takes away from the movie a bit. The speech itself just felt odd and was a bit on the nose compared to the rest of the movie, but they managed to tie it all up at the end of the movie fairly nicely so I am willing to overlook that. I really enjoyed the overall approach they took to the Barbie Movie and it had many little humorous surprises.I'd highly reccomend the movie. It was a fun time and even now the theatres are still packed!\", \"Barbie changed me for the better. It made me appreciate being a woman all over again, it made me appreciate my mother more and it made me more grateful to have 3 little girls. It'll make Barbie playtime more special and fun. It'll be a staple in my home and something that grows with me and my girls. It was funny, emotional, energetic and wholesome. Every time Barbie cried, I cried. Every time she laughed , I laughed. Growing up Barbie was my go to toy , it brought me comfort and fun. And as I had my girls it brings me joy to stand in the Barbie aisle as they pick out their favorite Barbie. Thank you so much for this movie. 💕\", \"What exactly is the movie about?Senseless, Stupid and illogical. Even the kids would hate this movie.There is no clear message. Only those people who played with barbie dolls as a child would like this movie. They must have felt nostalgic and must have liked this movie. I don't blame them.There is no clear logic around what barbieland is and what the real world is. If the barbies are all manufactured dolls, how do humans enter the barbieland. How the hell dolls and humans travel around different worlds? Using rollerblades lol.This is a complete pink mess. It is neither about feminism nor about patriarchy. Hence I can't comment exactly on what they have supported.\", 'People who followed all the lawsuits and all the Barbies throughout the years. It broke every single Hollywood Law in the books. Mattel made Satire out of their own overprotection of the Barbie Product. Margot Robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in Barbie. This is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely HATE Barbie. It is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movie.Know your Barbie History before coming to the movie. Know the lawsuits which Mattel brought to those who used Barbie as Satire. 64 years of history in.one hour and fifty-four minutes.', 'Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.', \"There is literally nothing to not love about this movie. Timing, perfect. Comedy, perfect. Ryan Gosling? Also perfect. Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie or purchase it when it comes out. It's rare to see something that synthesizes nostalgia, the societal journey of growing up (that extends generations) and balances this with comedy. There is a reason this debuted so highly at the box office and I am certain this will solidify itself as a cultural centerpiece for film schools in the future. Not only does it highlight long existing issues that half of the population has to endure, it does so in a way that you feel seen and can see others.\", \"A breath of fresh air, what an inspirational film on so many levels. Gretta showing the world of screenwriting just how it's done. I can't wait to see what new wave this brings to our cinemas. And what stories it inspires in younger generations of female creatives. If you don't agree, you're missing the point. Watch it again and listen to the subtext. And look around you, how many people came wearing pink? Don't underestimate the pink pound!Coincidence that this came out with Oppenheimer? A juxtaposed way of telling a story, this film shows everything that's wrong with rom coms and drama and all genres. If you're a writer, producer, director, sit up and take note.\", \"I am a big fan of Greta Gerwig but not a Barbie fan. I got excited by all the promo but didn't know what to expectThe movie exceeded my expectations so much. It was fun and absurdist but also profound.The depth in the movie is the perfect level - it doesn't go too far and still feels fun and playful but still does deep explorations. It's also just really funny and clever and campy in the best way.I loved the costuming, the set design, the cinematography and the acting. I was skeptical about Ryan Gosling as Ken but his performance was so good! Margot Robbie was perfect as well. This movie was so fun and so creative and interesting.\", \"I am shocked at how polarizing this movie has been in terms of feedback. I say this as someone who was not anxiously anticipating its release nor as someone who was triggered by it's growing popularity, I went into this with neutrality. I knew this would have more powerful messaging than it seemed as I am a fan of Gerwigs previous works, but I knew if it did not that the film probably would leave me unfulfilled. For that reason, I was most bored during the first section of the film that was too lighthearted childlike for my taste but I was excited to get into the deeper plot points. This being said, I recognize the film was marketed ingeniously to produce buzz, however it was ineffective in describing what the movie was really about. I can totally see why parents may have thought this was appropriate for children despite the PG-13 rating but this absolutely was not made for kids. This was a campy commentary on the patriarchy in America and the modern feminist movement. These plot points were actually my biggest criticisms of it. From my perspective this displayed an accurate depiction modern feminism, which often neglects to acknowledge it's roots grown by in black feminists and the patriarchies disproportionate effects on low income women, especially those of color. This movie promoted a feminist message that feels decades behind, and in such an obvious way that I am shocked that this explored new ideas or dramatically moved anyone in the audience. It was a blunt reminder of how behind we are but not even through the messaging in the film but rather how viewers are reacting. The only feminist commentary beneath surface level that I would've been more excited to explore were made via side comments from various side characters like the socialist/anarchist daughter (who by the way I found upset to have seen painted as mean and then only kind after conforming to barbie's ideas of feminism, but I digress). With all that being said, it had a fantastic soundtrack, made me laugh quite a few times and Ryan Goslings acting was superb (ironically) although the whole cast did well with the script they were given. Justice for Michael Cera's character! I would've loved to see his cravings to break away from societal norms be further explored! The movie was fun, campy in a more obvious way than I usually like, but that's the mainstream Hollywood box office industry for you. My overall take is this wasn't made for a person like me who craves exploring new ideas or highlighting important calls to action as they relate to feminism rather than this rehashing this surface level anti-patriarchy message. I am glad that this is making people converse in what I'm understanding are new ideas to many, I am just shocked that they are in fact, new.\", 'I thought the movie was amazing. Full of nuances.It is an incredible movie that goes in a completely different direction then I thought it would. I loved how they didn\\'t shy from the perception of Barbie. Also, it was very well cast, the characters were all fantastic. This isn\\'t just a \"girls\" movie, either! I absolutely loved it. I wouldn\\'t change a thing. I laughed, I cried, I was entertained the entire movie. The jokes were intelligent and a bit edgy. It may look like a silly action adventure, but textured dialog and rapid-fire gags add important layers of meaning. Great actors - great way of portraying silly messages and wonderful way of getting the important messages out as well. The movie had a great combination of humor and message.As someone else wrote in an editorial \"superficial yet smart, caustic yet clever, and showcasing not just the very best but even the worst of all things Barbie. No stone is left unturned and no doll is left behind.\"', \"Annnd it was a lot of fun at the beginning but about the time Kate McKinnon came in the movie just died nobody laughed but one lady and she laughed at everything. It was fun but it was about 20 minutes to long for me could cut out most the stuff towards the end. I get it Barbie didn't realize that Ruth was her creator. I don't know if we really need the whole speech either everyone already knows what Barbie is they could cut some out of thst scene it felt like it dragged on a little bit to long. It was nice to see the daughter of the lady who was playing with Barbie turned out to be better then she was at the beginning acting all crazy. Idk this movie felt eh to me.\", \"I had no idea what to expect but did not expect what I saw .I go to a few movies a week and always try to enjoy them based on their merits . I mean , not everything can The Godfather.I expected a movie that was just dumb fun, but it was not that .I thought the movie started ok and got interesting when Barbi went into the real world . I think the tried and true fish out of water concept would have been really worth exploring more in this movie .I thought casting was fine , Margot Robbie owns the screen and Gosling was ok . But you are only as good as the script you are given .The cinematography was fine. Barbiland was bright and colourful as you'd expect. No complaints there .I felt the agenda and messaging was way too heavy handed. A missed opportunity for nuance and balance . What the writers were trying to say was just super clunky and the victim of this was good story telling .I can't imagine children caring about what they were trying to say . What was advertised as a light hearted and breezy movie is really an attempt to be a social commentary. I think it's false marketing .Movie 4/10\\nMarketing 10/10.\", 'The movie starts with the presentation of iconic barbie world and hilarious childhood references but it gets progressively deeper.It tackles sexism, misogyny and existentialism. While it left me crying laughing it appeared a bit all over the place. I believe it would be a lot beter if it had only focused on one theme.Other than that it was an insanely self-aware, bizarre, iconic, relatable and suprisingly deep movie. Greta knew what she was doing. Goslings line delivery was hilarious and Robbie added range to an expectedly superficial character.I would also like to mention the heatbreaking yet beautiful Billie Eilish masterpiece of a song. Great job!', \"If you're making brand films, each of his directors reveals his own vision, and that vision generally lacks some points. However, I think Greta Gerwig knew all aspects of Barbie so well that she reflected it on the screen perfectly. Margot Robbie also played the part very well apart from a few small scenes. In fact, when Barbie is mentioned, the role is well-accepted. Of course, Barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie. By writing Ken as a one-dimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story, he significantly increased the directors of the movie games. Ryan Gosling had a great acting. Frankly, he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen. For the other Barbie and Ken players, the states didn't show much of a performance (Maybe Kate McKinnon). There were no such important scenes anyway. But America Ferrera didn't do a great job despite having a very available house. I wouldn't say that I played badly, but there are a lot of actors who give better use of that role in my opinion.\", \"The first half of the movie was pretty solid. Lots of tongue in cheek and fun humour. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were both very solid casting choices. Will Ferrell, was perfectly cast and hilarious as always. The portrayal of the Barbie world was very well done. The nasty shocks Barbie got when coming into the real world were also very funny. However, the movie soon descended into philosophical and political plot points which just felt weird. If it was just a bit more like Toy Story and a little less like Legally Blonde, it would have been perfect. It just took itself a bit too seriously and just laid some stuff on really thick. It's hard to know who this movie was pitched to. I would have thought it would be for families, but a lot of this would have flown right over many people's heads. It's a shame. It was a good idea, but poorly executed (as many Hollywood products have been recently).\", 'This movie should be seen by everyone in my opinion. Literally. I don\\'t care if you don\\'t like Barbies or pink, because this movie is so much more than that. It makes both women and men feel valid about their experiences and highlights how unequal our whole world currently is. The movie is also very comedic and has some really cool easter eggs about Barbie dolls and the development Barbie. The movie was very mature in my opinion and isn\\'t necessarily a kids movie even though it\\'s called \"Barbie\", a doll. It didn\\'t have too much K18 references but sexual harassment towards the main character was present so that should be taken into account when wanting to see the film with a child.Overall, absolutely beautiful movie and really touching. It\\'s not only about toys, it\\'s about life. Go watch it!', \"I didn't care for the movie. I even started to doze off a couple of times and had to force myself to stay awake.Like it or not, it's up to you, but please don't take your kids to see this movie. I was very upset by the number of young kids that I saw at this PG-13 movie.Most of the inappropriate things hopefully went over the kids heads, and there were some pretty inappropriate things that were said. I can't repeat them because my mother raised me better.I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this movie to only be upset by it.I did a double feature today and Haunted Mansion was a much better movie.\", \"Those three stars are for the visuals and production design. The movie is just unbearable and exhausting. It's a very undermining and a pointless movie. Thank God the runtime is short. I'm still trying to figure out who actually are the target audience for this. It's neither for kids nor for teens nor for women nor for men. I don't understand the point for making this movie. It begins very well, but tumbles down from there. Real-world seems more cartoonish than the Barbie world. That could be the real reason for Barbie to come out of Barbie-world and turn into a human. Relatability to any character is zero.What waste of two hours of my day!\", \"Everything was just so perfect. The cast, margot robbie is basically my fav person and ryan is also nice.. ig. I love how they added some actors from sex education like emma, connor and ncuti. The design was unbelievably perfect as well, the soundtrack, THE MESSAGE, EVERYTHING. I JUST LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH. It felt relatable, felt so many kinds of emotions at once which was an amazing and unique experience. LOVED IT GRETA AND MARGOT DID SO WELL!! I also loved how there were so many kinds of barbie's, like transgender barbie, allan which i think is non-binary and more.\", \"I loved all the details and give major props to the director. I feel so happy that we have a movie that is so empowering and really well made. Their was a great balence between each scene and captured the childhood vibes I used to feel when I was young playing with barbies/especially adding the over-used barbie with the cut hair and marked face. I loved each character and the message sent is very powerful and I'm glad for it. Really if anyone has anything negitive to say, think first about all the patriarchal movie that exist first, and let us have one slightly feministic movie without starting ww3, thank yew :)\", 'For some not so fun to see it the other way around.The expectations that challenge women on every step are impossible to empathise with. But are well said in \"breakout spell\", that woman isn\\'t allowed to make mistakes, yet she is responsible for all the mistakes. And the problems that Barbie experiences the second day are part of life and we know that world isn\\'t perfect and we all deal with it in our own way whether in flats or heels. And same goes for Kens, there is no need for stereotypes, just be Kenough.Living in 21st century is challenging for all, but let\\'s take everybody\\'s heads out of their a*ses and enjoy this ridiculousness that is happening all around shown on screen.The most spectacular part of it all is the art direction and attention to detail that brought so many easter eggs.', 'Actors 10/10\\nproduction 10/10\\nplot 2/10\\nthis movie is like a firework, starts bright and promising but ends up fading into the darkness.So basically Barbie selfishly sets out to help the girl who is playing her in order to restore her perfection ( wich turns out to be an adult woman) but in the end the girl ends up saving Barbie and Barbieland with little to no resolution to her own problems . But through all this Barbie realises she doesn want to go back to being perfect for everyone to project their ideals on her but just live as a regular human. Cute right? Yeah they only problem is NOTHING was convincing. The adventures of our characters were not enough to transform them yet they did change. The only well developed character was KEN. Not only his character arc was amazing compared to the others, it also was a fine commentary of how patriarchy damages young men. So of it was called Ken then I would have rated it like 7, but its a Barbie movie and unfortunately our female lead had the laziest character arc and the most Deus ex machina development ever.Ironically she was through it all really sweet and likeable. Maybe a meta commentary of what women are appreciated for? Sweet and likeable is enough but anything more is too much? And also she only wants to be seen as human? If so i congratulate the movie but i dont think it was clear enough to give it credit for.Maybe thats what you get when you are sponsored by whom you are supposed to critique... lol\\nps. I am a woman and a feminist and still hated it.', 'My expectations were very low for the movie but I am surprised. The Movie was literally good, the cast were fantastic, the set up delivered the fabulousness of the B world! Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie. I hope to see some elements from lgbti+ but it did not bothered me at all. Planning to go and see again.Ryan Gosling, he literally delivered his best. The soundtrack should have some more elements from 80s 90s as the storyline mostly based on these years of Barbie.Paying a tribute to Ruth was amazing but they should have also pay a tribute to the original Barbie, Bild Lilli...', 'Laugh out loud humor, fantastic sets and costumes that contain a wonderful message. I took my teenage daughter and preteen son and we all were incredibly surprised by exactly how much we enjoyed the entire film. I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again. So do I because I think I will find deeper concepts on a 2nd watch. And the music was phenomenal!', \"Come on Barbie, let's go smash the patriarchy!Greta Gerwig is the freaking best!! Looking at all the one/two stars reviews written by obviously male audience (or males who haven't watched it, just wanna express their fragile and insecure masculinity) makes this film even more ironic and a mirror of our society. Brava, Gerwig!Must take your boyfriends, straight male friends, brothers to watch this film, a good way to educate them or you know, get the hell out of the relationship while you still can.It's not just a simple film anymore, it's a sensational experience, a work of new generation. Maybe it's not perfect, but we need this, the society need this, the straight white male dominated Hollywood absolutely need this.\", \"Very disappointed with this movie. The best part of this movie was the hype prior.The acting was great. The cast were extremely likeable and I thought the visuals were perfect for this type of film. Apart from the slightly good ending and the odd dance, I thought it was pretty average.I believe you can go two different ways with these kinda movies. You can either have a very deep and meaningful plot and some sort of twist to it. Or you can have a very fun watchable movie with an extremely catchy soundtrack. It was pretty much neither.The plot of this movie was very basic. Almost felt like a disney movie at times. With this, I thought it would be saved by making it funny and would have a catchy soundtrack. The comedy was very forced and apart from the odd song, it wasn't very memorable at all.I genuinely wanted to love this movie due to the buildup before. Unfortunately, it was just very average.\", \"This was a totally enjoyable movie and it started off with like the planet of the apes with the old fashion girls with the old babies dolls. I was the generation that started with Barbie so I thought it was very entertaining and more importantly I thought the costumes were totally spot on for the Barbie character as well as the Ken character.It kinda remind me of the Flintstone movie I saw years ago, but the designs were great and the costuming was great and the hall simplicity of Barbie and her Barbie village vibe was great.I'm not going go into any more details, but I would say that I would watch it again because it was an entertaining, and Ken was great, as well as Will Ferrell as the chairman of Mattel, and then Rhea Perlman being the maker of Barbie.Watch it! It will lighten your day\\nDiane.\", \"Barbie is a hot pink mess, that ironically sees world in two dimensional black and white. Aside from Margot and Ryan, all the characters are literal one dimensional bimbo.Yes, i'm aware of the over the top humour, and almost cartoonish art direction is intentional. Yes, there's supposedly more 'substance' , than the style's portrayed. But the message is so generic, and only on surface level that nothing that hasn't been done before.TO BE FAIR, some part of it is actually enjoyable, and i had a few laugh. Margot and Ryan are great, but the rest of the casts is awkard. And the ending is kinda nice. Overall it's ended up being a 'meh' for me.5/10\\nPuking rainbow.\", \"It was beautiful and brilliant, didn't expect it's gonna be too good. Greta tells the -ve side of the real world beautifully wrapped in humor and childhood nostalgia for many.Margot is the STAR, she's unreal man, whatever role she does it seems she's born for that.Ryan was brilliant and so was Will Ferrel, both did an outstanding job. The take on patriarchy is nicely done, Greta is a brilliant director.Just speechless to see how Margot Robbie every single time nail the character she plays, she's just outstanding whether it's Harley or Barbie, she's born to play these roles.Go and experience the Barbie world.\", \"I believe that everyone who said it was preachy just doesn't get it, the joy and pain this movie brought me makes it such a wonderful piece of art. The pacing of the movie was excellent as well. I never found myself checking the time waiting for it to end, i was engaged throughout. The comedy in the movie is very well done it felt fresh and not coming across as trying to hard. For me the best part was the end, that beautiful montage of women the cast and crew submitted to remind us that these women are all around us everyday and that we need to love eachother most of all. I will definitely watch it again.\", 'Today I went to see this movie and I was so excited. I loved barbie growing up and watched all the movies, this week I played the Dua Lipa Barbie song on repeat and showed up to watch it in my barbie jumper.I loved the start of it, it was fun and colourful. Ken was hilarious and I got the feeling the plot was going to be about Barbie trying to find a purpose like all the other barbies and Ken becoming his own person but I was really wrong.It took a weird twist and turned into this femenist, anti-men, preachy movie that really took all the fun out of it. The movie said Patriarchy more than it said Barbie and completely dumbed men down just to make the women look better. The movie constantly preached about equality but the film ended with the kens pleading for jobs but being refused. Complete waste of potential.', 'I was excited to see what this movie would delve into, and it being from a woman\\'s point of view sounded promising. I was expecting a fun, slightly superfluous film, but safe to say, it was so much more than that.The first thing I\\'d like to point out is the meticulous outfit designing, it perfectly encapsulates the energy of Barbie, but with a modern touch.The dreamhouse was designed with attention to even the tiniest details.I loved how a lot of elements of the movie were portrayed from the viewpoint of a little girl - The lack of water in Barbieland, Barbie \"flying\" to her car, and the \\'world\\' map.The movie just kept getting more and more enthralling. The exploration of the patriarchy in the \\'real\\' world is eerily accurate. The raw, unadulterated expression of the dilemmas of womanhood is one which speaks for women and girls all around the world.I appreciate how the movie concluded with not the return of the matriarchal Barbieland, but an effort to strive for equilibrium, which acknowledges the sentiments of both men and women, which is a progressive message to carry out.Handler\\'s dissertation on the immortality of ideas, and essence of humanity was quite profound.The acting, everyone\\'s, was entertaining and impeccable, without it , the movie could never be just as good.The soundtrack, while song-oriented, was still effective at projecting the vibe and aesthetic of the movie into one\\'s ears.Overall, this movie is more than just \"glitter and sparkles\", it symbolically confronts the facets of our society. It is truly a film, anyone,\\nBarbie fan or not, can appreciate, and should watch.', 'The first half is excellent, it starts with a 2001 Dawn of Man parody with Robbie as the original striped Barbie in place of the monolith, then shows us Barbieland. Barbie is overrun with morbid thoughts, so travels to the Real World with a stowaway Ken.At this point, it starts to lose its way - it gets bogged down in preaching against patriarchy - a word used so many times you could sip low-alcohol beer every time they say the word and be unconscious by the end.Characters give long monologues on how it\\'s \"literally impossible to be a woman\", and the Barbies turn the Kens against each other bizarrely by using their sex appeal to evoke jealousy (is that really a feminist message?!).Whatever they were trying to say here, it doesn\\'t come across well. It\\'s preachy, on-the-nose, and too unbelievable to communicate a real message. Other films like Gone Girl with its Cool Girl monologue, or comedies like Bad Moms, make the point this movie seems to be trying to make much more effectively.Barbieland looks amazing, and the first sections there are fun (the whole patriarchy messaging was wisely cut out of the trailers). It would have been better to make this a Fool Triumphant story like Legally Blonde, where Stereotypical Barbie (as Robbie\\'s Barbie is known) is seen as an airheaded bimbo in the real world yet proves herself.', \"This movie definitely wasn't what I expected it to be. Although it was funny, it also had me question a lot of things in life. It hit the heart, it made me cry, and it really shows what the reality of the real world was and how we can all discover ourselves and not be making ourselves into someone we aren't. I walked into the theater thinking it would be all fun and like any other Barbie animation made in the past, but it definitely stood out and all the actors did great. Most women will definitely feel a sense of courage to do what they want in life and maybe also the men.This was a 10/10 movie. Definitely recommend to watch.\", \"I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this, english isn't my first language. This is seriously one of the funniest movies i've ever watched. I laughed everytime Ryan Gosling was on screen, he was my favorite in this movie. The only thing i would say wasn't the absolute best was the storyline. I felt like it was like 3 stories all in one movie and they shifted to those stories really fast. I did like the feminist vibe because it was all without hating on men. I think this would be a perfect movie for everyone. In my theater it was mostly young females tho, but i don't think it's made only for them!\", \"My childhood was spent with Barbie, Barbie's films and dolls, bag, clothes and notebook...and now I'm so happy and grateful. Watching this movie tooks me back to my sweet childhood memories. Everything was that I expected. Pink world and lots of beautiful Barbie's and handsome Ken's gathered together. And it's interesting that just as we played with our dolls, the Barbies in the movie were also taken into play! Then one of my childhood dreams that was Barbie in the real world came true and it was interesting to me...\\nHow wonderful it is that Margot Robbie was chosen to perform this role.. She did it perfectly.\", 'Greta Gerwig\\'s Barbie is a very interesting watch for a person like me. I\\'m the type of guy this movie makes fun of in it\\'s two-hour runtime (I enjoy Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League and The Godfather), and it certainly was a weird experience. So, yes, Barbie obviously isn\\'t for me, but I\\'m going to do my best to give my actual complaints about the film without making it sound like I\\'m butthurt about its jokes about the patriarchy.First of all: it gets far too preachy. Gerwig could\\'ve kept the message of feminism in Barbie, but she could\\'ve made it so much subtler than it is. There are constant speeches about feminism and patriarchy. I mean, it gets crammed down your throat about every fifteen minutes. The worst one was when a tween (yes, a literal twelve year old) started preaching to Barbie about consumerism, fascism, and capitalism like she was Jaden Smith talking about the political and economic state of the world. It was insane and laughable.Second of all: the messaging was really messed up and concerning. The end of the movie felt like it was setting up for an actually sweet and heartwarming ending about equality, but it was ruined when the Barbies refused to give the Kens any equality. What the heck was the movie even for then? The Barbies went through literally no character development while the Kens were actually funny and had the only development in the film. Also, the way the Barbies regained power in Barbie Land was baffling. No joke, they ended up making it look like they were cheating on their Ken boyfriends to make the Kens jealous of each other so they would fight. There were absolutely no reprocussions the Barbies had to face for doing this. It was insane. The movie basically taught little girls they should manipulate guys and make them jealous of each other to get what they want.Third of all: Will Ferrell is wasted. He is a big part of the first half of the movie but just kinda disappears in the second half. It\\'s almost like Gerwig forgot about his character but then said \"oh yeah, it\\'s Will Ferrell, we should probably give him a quick scene at the end.\"The only part I really enjoyed in this film was Ryan Gosling and all the other Kens. He is an absolute scene stealer. No one clapped when the movie ended, but people (including me) clapped when Gosling finished his \"Just Ken\" song. It was hilarious. You can tell he was really having fun with it. But all the other actors are just meh. Margot Robbie looks like Barbie, yes, but she doesn\\'t really do anything else to stand out.Overall, Barbie is just wasted potential. What a shame.', \"Great film which has a good balance between politics, feminism and film making. It was funny, sad and exciting, with great acting to pull it off. The set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line. The ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively. Mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they weren't necessary to be discontinued. Overall a great film and good to see with the family, it would be really recommended if you have younger children! They should love it.\", 'As must of recent movies and series, it was a mix of many important subjects and thesis but didn\\'t go through. All were touched superficially (Barbie) and forzed... dont understand how it has such a high rate here... really?The only thing I believe was ejecuten flawless was the movie set, the outfits, and the choreography. Otherwise, I dont thing it concluded any subjects or even really their true point of view. Was just a mix of social \"nowadays must talk\" without any sense or logic or concluded point of view from the characters or writters. Also tryed to be funny and touching, but didnt accomplished... just nonsense...', \"This movie deserves all the praise and the awards it'll surely win! I couldn't stop laughing. It's full of smart jokes, touching moments, and has one of the best sets I've ever seen in a film. Highly highly recommend. It has a wonderful message for both men and women. I hope the success of this movie leads to more films directed by, starring, and made for women. Hollywood has spent far too long catering to men, I see a cultural shift in the next few years. Women want good movies too, with strong, well developed, independent female characters that don't rely on men to interact with one another. Looking forward to more movies like Barbie.\", 'There are a lot of mixed reviews about this film and I really do not understand the point the people that do not like it are making. Nowadays I feel like we are too insensitive to what actually is happening in the world around us. I\\'ve read reviews stating that this movie is too heavy-handed and trying to be feminist and political. And yet Oppenheimer got more reviews and stars despite it being 100% political. It\\'s like the world is doing exactly what the Barbie movie tells is happening. There is a serious divide in the way people approach feminism and it is honestly really sad that people think that this movie is \"Pitting men against women\" and vice-versa. Although I do not agree with the ending statement of the movie, \"And the Kens one day will achieve as much power in the Barbie land as women hold in the real world\", but in the end Barbie land is really just a reflection of the real world, just opposite, in order to open people\\'s eyes to the fact that yes, women are discriminated against still and that they do not hold much power and autonomy in our world even today.', \"Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right! The casting was incredible. Even Ryan Gosling, who I beforehand thought was too old, was great and obviously well chosen for this role. Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin.There is diversity, modern issues and a whole lot of fun, the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing. I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye-opener to many people (admittedly, mostly men) on how society views women in day-to-day life.\", \"The heart of the director and screenwriters was in the right place in wanting to include current issues and acknowledge how diverse and troubled our society is. However, it lacked cohesion. Today's world is certainly patriarchal, but the film's story was vague and filled with too many topics (poorly developed) and platitudes The role of some of the actors, such as Will Ferrell, seemed meaningless to me. The film covered important themes, but wanted to cover too much and yet covered nothing.The animation, cinematography and effects are wonderful. But the story falls short.I do not recommend it.\", 'This movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film I feel so seen and acknowledged. I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn\\'t put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.Unlike what some people might believe it is not \"anti men\" the whole point of Ken\\'s story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous, not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm. In the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person. I don\\'t understand in what world that message is \"anti men\".', 'At the beginning there were little girls playing with dolls. Then came Barbie. The narrator said something about them pretending to be mothers to their dolls and then they (the little girls/toddlers) began to destroy their dolls. I don\\'t know about you, but for me, they imply that being a mother is somewhat something negative. Barbie is meant to inspire young girls to be whatever they want, but why do they suddenly make it sound like wanting to be a mother is not something good they can strive to be? So if a little girl wants to be a doctor or an astronaut, that\\'s fine (it is), but if she wants to be a mother, it sounds as if it is frowned upon. Tsk tsk.Also, I just can\\'t understand why Barbie and Ken can\\'t be equals. Why do we need one extreme or the other? Why do we need to have COMPETELY Barbie or COMPLETELY Ken? Why can\\'t it be BarKen land? Or KenRie land? You may argue that at the end they somewhat reach equality between Barbie and Ken, but in my opinion, it\\'s not true. Barbies \"allow\" the Kens to also be politicians, but just at a lower ranking. That\\'s equality? I also noticed that once Barbie and Ken first went into the real world, Ken saw that men can also have jobs. From my point of view, he was just very excited that he, a man, could also have a job, but he just became an extreme.Honestly, we have fought for equality, and what is this? Teaching young children that you can only have one or the other, but not a balance? Doesn\\'t this remind you of 60-70 years ago?', 'The marketing for this movie was incredible, so are actors and the whole setting. Not only does that attract a massive audience, but also seeing the famous doll many grew up with. Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can not wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can not decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might have been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot.', \"The theatre was filled to the brim with 99% women and girls wearing pink, we felt united in the moment of watching such a beautiful film. It's a comedy but it also offers a glimpse into the real world and what it's like for girls and women daily. It was beautiful and i can only wish for more people to go and see it. The laughs and the jokes were only a small portion of the emotions we felt we could just let out, it was emotional in the best way possible and was a moment that i am thankful i could share with my bestfriend. Directors like Greta Gerwig are what we need in this world for it to be complete.\", 'I was really excited to see Barbie, but sadly the film came up short for me.On the positive side of things, the film has plenty of creativity and the idea of recreating the doll\\'s actual world was a cool one (no stairs, no liquid in cups, feet permanently on tip toes, etc). Margot Robbie was excellent as always. Cudos to Mattel for their willingness to sign off on a film that depicts their company in such a negative light. That isn\\'t something you commonly see.On the negative side of things, the plot felt a bit like a rehash of the dozen or so other films I\\'ve seen that feature a \"two worlds colliding theme.\" A lot of the silly ideas I was expecting to find funny (the beach off) fell flat for me and seemed to rely more on just saying the same joke over and over, rather than using it in a creative way.The film\\'s messages about the crushing weight of society\\'s expectations on women and the uneven distribution of power/respect felt hamstrung by the lack of depth in the characters. Ken (Gosling) comes off as an idiot for the entire film and the CEO of Mattel feels more like a cartoon villain than a real person. In the end, the barbies don\\'t aim to create a more just society, but are content instead to simply replicate problematic structures in the opposite direction. The film ends with little to no character development, no one seems to have learned anything by the end of the film. The patriarchy, which this film centers around, is reduced in places to drinking brewskies, horses, and brainwashing. Those kind of reductions make it hard to appreciate the social message that the film portrays and sells the audience\\'s intelligence short.Part of the problem for me, I think, is I am unsure of who the target audience for this film is meant to be. If this is meant for children, the simplistic characters and over the top messaging might make sense but the themes and jokes feel a bit dark and too adult for them. If this is meant for adults, the characters lack the nuance that Gerwig was able to show in some of her other work (Ladybird).In the end, there are a few fun moments in this film, but the films heavy handed messaging mixed with the lack of depth/nuance in characters means it doesn\\'t hit nearly as hard as it probably should have.', 'This movie was definitely made for everybody. It had hilarious scenes and a few sad ones. And I was always told when a movie makes you laugh and cry, it\\'s a great movie. The plot and message was unexpected, in a good way though. I could also tell that it touched people. In the theatre, I heard \" oh my god,\", sniffles, and gasps. The cast and acting was off the top and the detail was, too. Although, you may here some comments saying, \" Oh this movie is sexist against men,\". You really have to see the movie to understand it. The people that are saying those things, obviously have not seen the movie. It\\'s just so good, I would be able to watch this everyday. It is definitely worth the money to see it.', \"This is the best movie I've seen in last 5 years. It's fun from beginning till the end. It is just what you would expect from a barbie movie, but it's also so much more. The plot is excellent, there is a lot of cool cameos and there is a new surprise in every second of the movie. It's unpredictable, so funny and it's also kind of deep. Would recommend 10/10.\", \"Don't let people scare you away from watching this movie, especially if you're a woman. It's definitely more deep than I thought it would be, there were some issues I didn't 100% relate to, and some parts I felt were a tad exaggerated- however I loved it! To those people who say it hates on men, etc: you obviously didn't pay attention. In fact, you should have realized that the way they treat men in the movie is there to show how a lot of women were and still are treated in some ways today. Overall, just watch it with an open mind and take in all of the good messages it has- especially at the end.\", \"When we saw the trailer for this movie I knew that my wife was going to want to see it. I really wanted this to be a fun movie and figured it would poke fun at itself a bit. Ryan Gossling and Morton Robbie did a great job as actors. But they were not given a cohesive script and story line. This movie was all over the place. It was not fun and it never is when you are watching overlong dialog, songs, and dance routines. I'm not sure I can even explain the main storyline of this movie. Is that Barbie wants to be real? Does she want to help the girl, now woman that used to play with her fix the relationship with her daughter. Was it about Ken not wanting to exist as an accessory? Overall, this was not fun, funny and ended up being tedious and actually boring. This is not a movie for little girls and it is not a movie for adults either. This is a really big missed opportunity.\", \"Wow If this film is spectacular and weird And I loved every single second of it I also think the cast was perfect especially ryan gosling Marga robbie If you want a film Makes you feel everything that has to do with happy I highly recommend this film I Also the Is over all message of the film Was pretty positive and great And no humans Are definitely not perfect And I just think that's the Positive message anyone could say in a film I definitely hope this film gets a sequel And I also think that it was very clever the way they Is made this Is film self aware And even the greater appeared herself Highly recommended.\", '\"Barbie\" should be the only movie I can give 10/10 this year. Both the rhythm of the plot, the tribute to the toy are perfect. Also, from feminism and women\\'s own awakening to the awakening of self is the perfect theme. The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify. Let\\'s hope Mattel releases more and better Barbie in the coming years. I really hope you guys could come to cinema and see this movie.', \"I had good expectations from this movie but I decided to watch Oppenheimer in theatres instead of this. As the movie has hit digital, I watched it.I enjoyed the movie; it had drama, comedy, music and most importantly entertainment value. The story was good and nicely executed, the screenplay was good, the direction was good but the performances were above average rather than being good. The pacing had some issues but that can be neglected as you will be enjoying the movie from the start till the very end.Overall, you should give this movie a try. For me, it doesn't have any repeat value but it's it deserves a shot.\", 'It is a film of absurd humour (which is funny in many moments) that criticises political models, fragile masculinity and society both past and present.The approach is to turn current society on its head and make Barbieland a world dominated by women, where they form the elite of society and the Kens are simply their boyfriends, irrelevant, unemployed, kept, objects. Basically what women are in the macho society.When Barbie and Ken arrive in the real world, Barbie realises that the world is upside down, that they are the objects and that the world is dominated by men, and Ken discovers the patriarchy and wants to carry it out in Barbieland. So far, the script and the critics are being perfect.After a lot of criticism of the hetero-male behaviour of men when it comes to flirting and leaving them to their basic behaviour, the critical moment arrives, the message of the film. The Barbies fight against patriarchy and supposedly don\\'t want to go back to the previous model where they ruled. I say SUPPOSEDLY, because they do go back to that model. One Ken asks the president of Barbieland if they can be part of the courts and the president\\'s answer is, yes, but from below and little by little.In the end the Barbies, after discovering the reality of the real world, adopt the same model. They do not accept the Kens as equals, NO, let them gradually integrate. Just as it has happened with women, who are gradually being removed from the wage and work discrimination against women. It was the perfect time to talk about equality, to think about a new model, about evolution. And there is no solution, the barbies continue with the model of today\\'s society. So the film doesn\\'t contribute anything, what is the wonderful message, they just show the path of women and turn it around so that in this case it is the man who is discriminated against. If you make a social and political criticism, you have to propose your own solution. In Barbie there is no solution, the solution is the current system.Therefore it is overrated. And on top of not showing the reality of the \"Barbie world\" they show Barbies of all races and sizes, do they sell XXL Barbies? Or Barbies and Ken of all races? They show a diversity that the Barbie universe has never had.', 'Ambitious mess, its not a polished jewel without flaws.Can see this having true potential and understand people admiring the fearlessness more then the result and giving it a 10.Think you can go watch this if you expect it to be a 5/10 that is flawed and with a good mood you can still enjoy the experience. Go to it expecting a 10 and think your doomed.There is certainly things in this movie to enjoy indeed think it has to many ingredient. The acting of Ken and Barbie are great ironical they get to show off their range by literally barbie/ken.This site really need to lower the minimum review number of words as could have certainly made the same point with half the words, given the option.', 'This was perfectly cast. I mean Ryan Gosling as Ken (I just can not picture anyone else doing it that well). Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera\\'s \"Allan\" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful.', \"I went in the cinema optimistic as the trailer looks really good, comedy, entertaining. But the trailer shows the only good scenes throughout the whole film, the rest I never had a bloody clue what was happening half the time, The film didn't make any sense what so ever, besides from the first 30 minutes & the dance scene which was very well performed the rest was a catastrophe.I have to praise Margot Robbie for her performance, despite the deplorable storyline, her acting was outstanding. On the other hand Ryan Gosling's acting/performance was cheap, cheesy, & overall cringeworthy. A massive shout out to Kate McKinnon her scenes were the hilariously funny, I love her originality.Overall not for me, as the storyline is atrociously written & didn't make sense.\", \"This movie was a massive let down. It was never really funny and just kept pushing political issues in my face. I don't care about politics when I'm watching a movie, and I expect a well written story. This film is just bad, and I was actually interested in it. I had high expectations for this film and I think it did not deliver. It's not a valid social commentary because it does not prove there even is a patriarchy and give an example in real life. Actions speak louder than words and this movie is so overrated that I created an account just to leave a bad review. What did I even see in this film? It's a BARBIE MOVIE.\", \"This movie was so absurd and so fun! I laughed so hard my face hurt. I see people feeling like this movie concluded that women are better than men, but the lesson was to celebrate womanhood in all its forms, with the overarching message for everyone being to find who you are on your own. Barbie told ken he should stand in his own light and find out who he is outside of his relationship with her! He's kEnough!!! I think because this was such a big budget and highly publicized movie, people don't super know who greta gerwig is and how her past movies have really celebrated womanhood through all its phases, especially the messy parts. It was so fantastic and so nuanced and self aware, i'm grateful this movie exists! P.s. If ur mad that the barbies didn't give the kens true parity and just threw some lower level judge position at them, then wait until you find about what the supreme court in the real world does!!!!\", \"I sort of went into this with low expectations.It was extremely entertaining from start to finish. The opening scene that mocks 2001 sets the tone well. It's Barbie but it is not dumb and there are subtle film references throughout and a lot of them will only be picked up by people who have spent their lives watching and studying film.It is very silly and tackles serious issues at the same time. It is also attacking what Barbie represents but it also shows love.The films main strength for me is it's cinematography and incredible choreography in the Ken's at war scene.Also the comedy is very intelligent.\", 'Eric\\'s Grade: A-\\n2023\\'s \\'Barbie\\' from writer/director Greta Gerwig has blown expectations out of the water, and not only become the highest grossing film of the year, but has captured the zeitgeist to become a veritable cultural phenomenon. The film is a fantasy comedy starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling with significant supporting roles going to America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Rhea Perlman and Will Ferrell. The movie is co-written by Gerwig\\'s partner Noah Baumbach. There have been more than a few animated \\'Barbie\\' films, but this is her first foray into live action. As August 2023 comes to an end \\'Barbie\\' has set box office records becoming the highest grossing film of the year, the highest grossing film ever directed by a woman and is in the top twenty highest grossing films of all time.Robbie stars as Barbie (technically Stereotypical Barbie) and Gosling is Ken most commonly referenced as Beach Ken. They reside in Barbieland which is a matriarchal utopia where many variations of Barbies and Kens reside in perfect happiness along with a few odd, discontinued Barbie models. These real life dolls are under the impression that life in the real world reflects their happy, unencumbered existence in Barbieland thanks, not in small part, to their very existence and the example they set. Out of the blue Barbie begins having odd feelings of morbidity, and her perfectness is deteriorating. It is determined that her malaise is a reflection of the child playing with her in the real world, and she must journey there and set things aright if she is to get her perfect Barbie groove back. Ken joins her and together they venture to the real world which is not the carefree paradise they believed. Along with that Barbie and Ken discover the nature of the real world patriarchy which Ken attempts to bring back to Barbieland threatening its very existence. It becomes Barbie\\'s mission to not only save the girl who has her doll in the real world, but also restore Barbieland from the lunacy of the Kens\\' burgeoning patriarchy.When I first heard \\'Barbie\\' was being adapted I was more than a bit skeptical. I was intrigued after learning Gerwig and Baumbach were attached as they are at the forefront of some of the more intelligent film making coming out of Hollywood these days. Still how exactly would \\'Barbie play? This could be a silly film that turns into a financial disaster. Instead it walked a hyper intelligent line of silly comedy mixed with incisive social satire and feminist messaging. It doesn\\'t do it in a way that talks down to or belittles men though which is also key to an overall success. It taps a similar vein that \\'Black Panther\\' tapped a few years ago for the black community. Here though it taps the often under served female portion of our population. From the opening scene that is a pantomime of the famous \\'2001: A Space Odyssey\" opening it is clear that this is a film maker in control of her craft and the story she is about to embark on. Especially in this day and age a very blatant feminist core message might not sell, but it does its task in such a fun and subversive way encased in a bright, candy coated shell with catchy music that it is hard not to get on board. If there is any misunderstanding though the message certainly becomes clear in the epic diatribe that is delivered by America Ferrera as Gloria on what it is like and the expectation placed upon being a woman in our modern society. \\'Barbie\\' does an excellent job of dissecting the seeming dichotomy of Barbie itself. That is on one hand the dolls are meant to be empowering for women as the myriad of different Barbies come with different careers and different skin tones, and are meant to show young girls that they can be anything. On the other hand Barbie has become a negative stereotype for a perfect, unattainable idea of womanhood that contributes to many normal girls feeling inadequate in themselves for a myriad of reasons. It has hilarious and pointed commentary on the nature of the patriarchy as Gosling\\'s Ken put the concept in place in Barbieland to both hilarious and appalling effect. About the only thing that didn\\'t work for me in the story is the Mattel board of directors. They are yet another example of the real world patriarchy headed by Ferrell\\'s character. The problem is that the real world is set up as, more or less, a realistic depiction of life in direct counterpoint to the fantasy world that is Barbieland. The exception to that appears to be Mattel and its board of directors which skew towards slapstick lunacy and seem out of place in the primarily real world setting. That aside \\'Barbie\\' is fun and insightful. I think it is clearly targeted toward women and girls especially those with \\'Barbie\\' experience, but it clearly becomes about women as whole. Along with that it is accessible to men who go in with an open mind, and realize that even as the struggle for equality and self fulfillment has come a long way since 1959 that road continues on and does not dead end in the present.', \"Absolutely AMAZING!!!!I do not know how it is possible but the Barbie movie exceeded my expectations and then some!!! It was sooooo dang hilarious!!!I love the silliness, aesthetics and nostalgia of it all plus the laughs just kept on coming. Of course they had to build a story so there were a few long monologues but there were soooo many laugh out loud moments throughout the whole movie.Also, Lets talk about Ryan Gosling...Who knew he was so funny.. He killed it as Ken! I was not expecting him to be so good. I will definitely be going back to the movies to watch it again...Oh yeah, BTW Its DEFINITELY PG-13 so I wouldn't bring the kids..\", 'If you are a girl and under 12 definitely go watch this movie. If you are anything else read my review: Not sure what i was expecting before, but I was clearly disappointed in the plot. A boring start with some interesting moments during the middle, and a super boring ending. Maybe the visuals were indeed nice, but thats not enough or at least should not be. Margot is indeed worthy of the role, great acting, for that reason the 5 stars are more than enough. Glad that I did not pay for the advertisements and the propaganda ;)\\nSo in order to summarise, its not something i would recommend , the rating is over buffed, and the 2 hours of the movie is way too much.', 'I loved this movie more than I thought I would!! I laughed, cried, and honestly loved the message. All the niche references made me smile, too!!Normally I do not rewatch movies while they are in theaters but I am planning on taking my sibling this weekend so they can experience the same joy!I don\\'t understand the people who are upset over Ken being an accessory to Barbie. It is literally pointed out in the movie how misogyny is a huge problem in the real world and they are upset over one validating movie. Unbelievable. Please ignore the \"anti-man\" reviews. This movie isn\\'t anti-man. If anything, it\\'s anti-patriarchy and makes fun of it.', \"If it were possible to rate this movie a negative 10 I would. Twenty five minutes in, and I was ready to walk out of the theater. It was without a doubt one of the silliest, most stupid movies I have ever seen in my life. It finally got a little better 30 minutes in, which brought it up to a negative three. Want an extreme waste of the talents of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. How did anyone ever convince them to star in this pink train wreck of a movie? Newsflash to Margo and Ryan, you're only as popular as your last movie! Lots of careers have gone into the toilet after a lousy movie like this one!\", \"I absolutely adored this movie, without spoilers I can say it's truly fun and surprisingly a lot deeper than you would initially think going into it. Beyond that I thought the cinematography was fantastic and the color palette was perfect, and above all else the acting was amazing from everyone in it! Especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, I know people were hesitant to accept him as Ken but he really knocks it out of the park, and I honestly cannot believe they considered people other than Margot Robbie to be Barbie. It's like she was BORN for this role. Absolutely adored this movie and I hope no one listens to the review bombing, it really is a treat!!\", \"I went and saw this with one of my best friends and it was a quite ride. We laughed, we cried, we had a great time! Barbie was definitely one of the best films we've seen all year! This was relatable on so many levels! I personally felt that there really is something in this movie for everybody! It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well! The entire cast was absolutely incredible in making this film both be true to what Barbie is to little girls and what it did for children growing up!\", \"I wanted to like this movie but it was just plain silly. Maybe it's meant for pre-teens. I can't believe Margo and Ryan needed the money so bad they accepted these roles. Ive also noticed that Goslin puts way too much make up on and a lot of the shots are animated or touched up digitally to make him look younger. He is 43 yrars old. Thiwcis not the type of role for him. Hollywood really needs to step up when it comes to quality. Barbie movie??? I mean, that's just unnecessary. I can't believe some people here thought it was entertaining. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Avoid at all costs.\", \"This movie has such a powerful message for women everywhere! The set is amazing and the movie is so funny. The writing is so clever and funny! It made me feel so powerful and validated! I really enjoyed it! Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie! And Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken! I feel like the chemistry between them and all of the other Barbies and Kens were great! I loved how there were different type of Barbies in the movie! Being a woman is amazing and powerful and I hate how the world doesn't respect us or take us seriously. There was some slow parts and jokes that didn't land for me but overall it was a great film!\", 'I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I found out it would exist. I turned my whole world pink. And then I was sitting there in the cinema hall, bored. Yes, I did like the pink Barbie Land. Yes, I loved how they portrayed the actors as innocent Barbie/Ken/(Allan) dolls in their childlike fantasy world. But what happened next? Barbie faced depression, thoughts of death, cellulite, and flat feet (actually, I kind of liked how they freaked out because of that lol). Well, okay, fine - this could still turn out great, couldn\\'t it? Barbie and her \"obviously pain in the neck\" Ken, who appeared more relatable to me than Barbie herself, embarked on a playful and lovely journey to the \"real world.\" The CEO of Mattel kind of saved that real-world experience for me. Barbie meets a rebellious teen girl and her mother in a crisis and takes them back to Barbie Land, where Ken, who figured out that men can also rule the world, turned the pink glitter style into a \"Kendom.\" So far, so good. What happened next was just annoying and confusing. I\\'m saying this as a 26-year-old woman. There were endless speeches about how hard it is to be a woman and a mother. And when Barbie decided to live as a human - the already known talk about how cruel human life can be. The only refreshing thing was Ken\\'s battle and the song \"I\\'m just Ken.\" The ever-popular Barbie turned out to be an aging woman who just can\\'t get on with her life and treats the only person who is always by her side (her Ken) like trash, which was the worst for me personally. I felt like no one in the full cinema hall laughed at all during that movie. And the people left the cinema confused and silent.', 'I went to see this movie after hearing all kinds of \"propaganda\" about it so I wasn\\'t sure what to expect. I absolutely loved it! It was hilarious, thought provoking, inspirational, and an all around great movie. Definitely geared towards adults but the jokes that may be mildly inappropriate (and I do mean MILDLY) will go over kids\\' heads. I loved seeing the character arcs and how each of them grew and changed ultimately for the better by the end of the film. While I was I initially hesitant to go and see it I loved it and would absolutely watch again. I recommend this movie whether you love Barbie or have mixed feelings.', \"I don't understand all the criticism. I thought it was great. I don't think it's too preachy, I think it's educational and smart. I feel like I learned a lot and I hope other people did too. I heard someone say that the barbie movie Barbie said so many things yet said nothing at all. Meaning it should have been bolder. But I think it said a lot. It doesn't tell you what to think but it's a reflection of the real world that we live in. I'll probably rewatch it just to hear the dialog properly. And I loved the fashion. It made me feel more confident in being a grown woman and not a baby or a teen. It's kind of grownup outfits yet it doesn't hide the fact that women wants to be pretty amd wear high heels, and that it makes them happy.\", 'Obviously everyone and their mom knew of the hype this movie has made and it was. That\\'s why i brought myself to see the movie in the cinema instead of waiting for its online release.Thankfully so - the movie was an amazing journey and boy did I enjoy coming along.I really really enjoyed the movie\\'s dive into the more tricky aspects of our gendered world and the politics around it.It made a good critcism of the shallow liberal understanding of feminism and its right-wing \"critics\" - it explores the ideas of a better egalitarian way without making it unfunny, serious or dull.Amazing movie!', 'This movie was not what I expected at first, but I loved it. It\\'s been years since I watched a new big budget movie that was so bright and fun with its own sense of logic. Taika Waititi said in an interview that Hollywood (particularly superhero) movies have gotten so dark and when he was a kid he went to the cinema to escape the darkness of life. I feel like Barbie could be the start of the un-darkening of Hollywood movies.As a woman with some trauma, I love a good gritty woman-run movie that talks about how life feels as a woman in a man\\'s world. Sometimes though, you just want some feel-good escapism that isn\\'t forcing you to watch the female protagonist go through all sorts to get the message across.I\\'ve seen other reviews say that a lot of the movie didn\\'t make sense. I feel like the way they executed it made sense for a Barbie movie. I\\'ve also seen other reviews say that the feminist message of the movie missed the mark since Kens aren\\'t equal in Barbieland, I loved that part especially. In the same way that I don\\'t like feminine trauma being graphically shoved in my face in a movie for the sake of a thinly veiled message, I think it also sucks when a movie takes *too* light of an approach because it\\'s scared to actually say something. Of course the Kens aren\\'t equal in Barbieland 1) Ken was literally invented as a boyfriend for Barbie because parents thought a single lady with a job was \"loose\" and 2) they are toys made by people, they are a product (lol) of their makers. So yes, Barbies are in charge, but Barbieland is just another world created by men and the ideology of misogyny (or any form of bigotry) states that someone can only be dominant if someone else is subservient.The audience in the theatre I was in seemed to feel the same way, because when the narrator said, \"Well, the Kens have to start somewhere. Eventually they\\'ll have as much rights as women have in the real world.\" I swear everyone was laughing. It really connected with the audience from what I saw. So many clever points were made in a nonsensical Barbie pink package and it was just perfect. If you made it this far on my review, you\\'re going to have the best day ever today. And tomorrow. And the day after that. And every day from now until forever <3.', \"My mom aunts and my sister and my cousin Emily and Maddie grew up with Barbie and Ken for almost their entire childhood to adulthood. After seeing the Barbie movie it made me laugh and see what it's like to grow up with a doll that my sis played with all the time when I was a toddler . I remember my sis having a giant Barbie toy when she was about 4 and she played with her all the time and dressed her with her clothes . But now that Barbie reached theaters my sis and mom realized Barbie is more then just a toy she's the fashion model to all Barbie's from the 60s 70s 80s 90 2000s to now .Barbie welcome.\", \"Barbie is definitely one of the best films to bought out to cinemas this year, or even longer than that. It had us laughing from the start to finish, crying in some moments and scenes so overall it was an emotional rollercoaster. Greta has done a great job and balanced a mix of fun and hard truths about the world we live in today. For people say this isn't worth watching, clearly don't know how to let a film just transport you away into its world for a moment, absolutely brilliant film, I'd pay to go and watch it again. Well done to Greta, Margot, Ryan and all of the cast & crew for a fantastic watch!\", \"It's like a women's solidarity movie. It was a production in which all men were shown as 2nd class and this was done through a good cast and a well-established company. It's a totally overrated PR movie. Despite all this, the acting was successful. However, the movie did not meet my expectations. Ryan gosling and margot ronbbie are both good actors, but this scenario limited both of their abilities. In my opinion, product placement and advertisements were also over exaggerated. It was like the longest commercial I've ever seen in my life. I can say that I counted the minutes, especially for the last half hour of the movie to end, it was not a movie worth all this expectation.\", \"I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!\", \"THE GOOD ... Its bright and colourful ... Rhea Pearlman shows genuine heart ... Helen Mirren is fine as the narrator ... THE BAD ... I didn't laugh once, this is a complete wet rag as a comedy, in fact it is not better than an epitome of mediocrity in all departments and it is embarrassingly over sentimental in places ... ... The music is dreadful, you can't tell one piece from another ... If this is what studio writers are thinking is creative these days , then the fact is they are wrong and at least as regards Hollywood, AI probably could do better and you should sack the lot of them ... You need to learn that if you right stuff to satisfy the cultures all around the world and not upset anyone in the slightest, then you write stuff that doesn't satisfy anyone ... This had immense possibilities, but instead turned out to be a geriatric Barbie who had lost her dentures.\", \"Barbie had to carry the weight of everyone's expectations (just what the movie is talking about), and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing, perfect and everything in between. The barbie topic, no matter how superficial it may seem, is not easy to grasp and hard to portray. I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not.\", 'This movie is a mess. Story line is horrific ,and the writing is horrendous.it feels like somone put the script in a mixer grinder and made a shake out of it. Im still confused as to what the movie actually wants to potray.theres not a clear intended audience for this . It references so many old movies which makes it way too boring. Even the dialogues are boring . There is not a clear line in the story line. Way too much plugging of outfits.the producer actually spent more time on marketing than they on getting a good storyline.tmost of the jokes were annoying and cheesy.overall the movie is wierd and bogus.', 'This movie is an easy 10/10 for me, did not disappoint. The casting, the directing, the plot, the cinematography, the sets, the detail, the acting, the jokes, it was all perfect. I want to rewatch this movie already! I watched it with my family and it is definitely enjoyable for everyone, the kids might not understand the movie as much but my sibling still really enjoyed it. This movie made me laugh and cry, it focuses on womanhood and mother daughter relationships in both a light hearted and sad way. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie whatsoever, absolutely loved it and recommend.', \"I absolutely LOVED this movie! It was everything I could have ever wanted it to be and THEN SOME! Fun, empowering, intelligent, socially relevant, deeply moving and by far the pinkest movie l've ever seen! An all around an amazing experience and there's something in it for everyone! All genders, all ages, everyone can appreciate it. The entire audience seemed to have a blast throughout the movie. Everyone was laughing during the funny bits(and there were A LOT of them) and during the heartfelt, more emotional moments you could feel the energy shift and the messages the movie was trying to convey really being taken in. Amazing cast, excellent cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, you definitely want to see this one!\", \"This movie is made for adults, not suitable for children. Despite its marketing campaign that could easily be mistaken for a fun, kid-friendly film, it is riddled throughout with adult language, sexuality, and mature themes. It's a surprisingly unrelenting work of misandry, toxic relationships, and alternative lifestyles coated in the pink plastic shell of a beloved toy. At times it's hard to determine whether the message of the film is more about depression, disappointment, or death as the reality of the human condition. It's a clumsy attempt to paint people groups with a broad brush in order to win sympathy points for the main characters.The production was great, though. The music was stirring and heartfelt, and the visual presentation of the film was unique and enjoyable. The actors also brought movingly authentic performances. And there were some clever comedic moments that brought at least some relief to the suffocatingly heavy-handed onslaught of toxic messaging. It could've been a great movie.\", 'Briefing: 25 , Male , watched alone . Not in any relationship.Yo\\nGreta grewig, you joyous beauty! You are an absolute gem . I ll try watching your movies ( directed/acted ) . All the cast members, visuals, musicals , themes , costume design, choreography aside , let me just write about the story . The actual plot which progresses.There are some fairly thought subjective criticism too but they are minimum, completely avoidable.Here we see a doll living her best life . The opening invites you like a Disney animated movie when Disney was at their peak ! Like late 2010 or 11 ; The way Men toys are shown is literally cringe worthy (*cries.. cuz that\\'s desperate)\\nbut isn\\'t it the whole point ?! Every thing happens real smooth cha cha , then one day our Lady falls in her existential draid...This existential draid has been a recurring theme in many classics. From Taxi Driver to Sopranos ( two heavily Male centric fictional stories ) & in many Arthouse directors life long theme ; from Andrei Tarkovsky to Ingmar Bergmann.I was literally awestruck to find such a theme in this movie..\\n..\\nBut,\\nEverything afterwards is completely different than how typical existential draidy movies handles its story progression.Barbie decides to go to real world with Ken . A Ken which literally has no purpose in his life discovers adventure, PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY & gets deviated from his actual purpose. Here the humour elements are so heart touching that you ll feel your childhood fantasy in real life . From a Male POV , This is nothing less than seeing Transformers/Terminator /Avengers/ G I. Joe for the first time in live action . See its definitely understandable how girls are going to perceive this .But make it even more enjoyable cause the humour element are so true! ( Both Barbie & ken getting sacked by cops! )The horror\\nThe certain realisation hits Barbie when she witnesses how or where the world is heading towards, How ken discovers Patrichy and leaves Barbie in the real world to invent kendom in Barbieland!Everything at this point goes downhill until she meets a woman who make her see the way . Not the Granny , no ..\\nThe mother who is still a child within her Heart .America FerreraApparently more than Barbie, Miss Ferrera \\'s character is made like an Angel. She helps Barbie by solving every little bit of her issues , healthy advices & that with a great masterplan. So simple yet so Damn effective! Go watch it , m not writing every detail!The transformation :\\nWe see Barbie showing a lot of emotions while staying true to her emotions. She experiences Anger , sadness, stubbornness, yet she stays kind . She listens to her Human domain , believes in her actions, doubtful but always stays optimistic.& I THINK THIS WORLD HASN\\'T GOT WOMEN LIKE THIS ANYMORE.Women nowdays are getting Cold , distant & are accepting Masculine traits desperatly to fight male egos thus destroying their Charisma, personality & Charm . See at the end , the journey comes to an end when a doll becomes human . That transformation, comes through 1) confusion , 2) anger issues (when ken forces himself to join barbie while accessing the human world) , 3) denial (barbie getting into mettel corp.) , 4 ) pain (Barbie meeting that human girl who calls her a capitalist/fascist , 5) agreement (planning to take over barbieland) & 6) still having complete understanding & empathy towards Ken . Saving ken when he breaks down & accepts KENS\\' defeat . Not even once , not even for once Barbie shows any type of Pride / jealousy / resentment.That makes her even more than a human.The ending , thats why feels perfect!She getting transformed into a human through such an interesting journey feels poignant. Not forced , not sketchy , not masculine but entirely simple , vivid & full of feminine traits.Sexism works both ways . (First Barbie getting annoyed over Ken\\'s desperation & later Ken taking over the Barbieland) This movie just shows if both Men & Women listen to eachother & work for their inner souls they can let go of their respective personal bad blood & stupid patriarchal things which has been a stigmata of this giant world. Gone are the days when Women only used to do household works & Nursery cause there is no World War Anymore\\nSo now its time to completely bury that stupid mentality.Ken realises it later like all men do\\n& I think Greta could have given him a better ending than making him wear a shirt which says \" i am kenough \" hilarious yet a bit lacky. -1 for that .And yes those childlike Bollywood songs , -1 for that.Still a clear W .This just shows if a doll can make right choices & becomes a human\\nA human female, if she chooses the right paths can become much more than just a woman. Lovely film . Great experience!Certified Kino stuff.', \"I brought my daughter to this. My eyes are still seeing pink a few hours later! My god how much did the paint budget cost. It's pretty woke thankfully my daughter didn't notice it as much as she is young. Some good gags but woeful bland story. Margo Robbie, is good but couldn't redeem this dumpster fire of a movie. Ryan Gosling also did his best with what he was given.My daughter thought it was ok, she told me that it wasn't as good as the other Barbie movies. She's referring to the animated films.If you have daughters bored on summer holidays it will kill an afternoon but remember you are paying to be preached at.\", \"Barbie was one of the most anticipated films of the year 2023. Many people made fun of him believing that he would be lame, and other people believed that he could actually be very good because of the cast and direction. Is it rough? In a way yes. But it's deliberately lame, they're living puppets, it's obvious that this is lame. The big complaint about the film is about the critics, as many people found it exaggerated and indeed it is, but again, it's on purpose. The criticism works very well, the characters work, the universe built here is incredible. Visually it is one of the most beautiful films of the year, a world all pink could be very strange, but it turned out beautiful and very convincing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are very good and manage to hold your attention, on the other hand, when they try to focus on other characters, the quality is not the same. Some characters don't work, particularly the businessmen who are featured in real life. Overall, this film is great and has earned its place among the best and most memorable films of 2023.\", \"It exceeded my expectations. Truly an amazing film. Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.It think it's a movie that has a significant impact after watching, is highkey emotional and touch themes that probably a 7 year old will not understand. I recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy (I cried twice during the film) and great sense of humor. But if you are a kid, you can also watch it, even though you will not undestand it a 100%, is visually pleasant!\", \"This movie is so cringe, the actors are there just to get the paycheck, no acting performance. I'm giving it 5 stars just for the plot and the editorial cuts and how it did bring joy to my little daughter.I have nothing against Barbie movie creators, though the casting crew shall choose some passionate actors. Margot and Ryan did bring some light to the movie by their performances, they nailed their roles, though it's not that good for the others.Overall it was a fun movie, did had some good jokes here and there, and my daughter now is really invested in Barbie as she wanted her own BarbieLand.\", \"So much garbage. I don't get this movie at all. Let me explain myself. This is the kind of movie you live the movie theater why the heck you wasted so much of your time watching this. What kind of audience was this movie made for? Doesn't look like it was made for kids, nor adults. Just a bit more of the work garbage trying to brainwash kids and change the way things are. Who thought this would be a good idea? Same thing happening with big franchises unfortunately. Margo Robbie as Barbie? Some movies like that appeal to our nostalgia, like Mulan, the lion king or scooby doo to name a few. This one failed doing so.\", \"I have not laughed so hard at a movie in such a lot time. There are so many tropes and explorations of what it means to be both genders, and they all just nail it. Could it have hidden the message more clearly? Probably, but then it would be a different movie.America, Margot, and Ryan all give amazing performances and they are backed with a fantastic supporting cast!The characters are great, it's done well, it's acted well, the set and costumes are beautiful, and the play with Barbie and the real world is fantastic. Cannot wait to see it again, likely in theaters and then buying it when out!\", \"I thought all the jokes were really funny and I felt a bit sorry for Ken while all the barbies rule barbie world all ken (Ryan gosling) wants is to be noticed by barbie (Margot Robbie) and when he goes to the real world and discovers that it's all about men and horses and he freaks out . I also loved the fact that all the barbies were not all skinny and blonde . I also thought that it was really sweet the way barbie met Ruth and Ruth was kind off like a mother to her and she helped her along the way in the movie . Everything was pink I can see how there was a shortage of pink paint . And it was really funny when the narrator was giving her opinion throughout the movie . So to all the cast, directors , producers and people involved well done . It was amazing. And it will give girls a lot off confidence for a long time .👏👏👏👏👏\", \"Salute to the marketing department for creating a buzz like no other, hyping up a film based on what many girls want or dream to be, probably. 1 point for Margot Robbie who is perfect as a barbie-like character, perhaps better becoming the brand ambassador of the brand and stars in all their ads.The film, not sure who's their targeting, children to convey the heavy social issues they are trying to preach, or adults to watch this abomination-children-kind of for, apart from the abs of Ryan Gosling and/or Simu Liu that they keep showing, film. The film tried to be funny, 😑, but the real joke is when somebody think that this is a film worth wasting 2 hours of their life. Ridiculous.\", 'Well, English is not my first language so I\\'ll try my best here.With the complete deconstruction of the concept of \"Barbie\", Gerwig subverted every stereotype you\\'ve associated with this \"not-so-feminist\" toy. She took an innovative approach to story-telling, struck a balance between flamboyant shots and down-to-earth narrative. Behind every joke there is a harsh reality. It\\'s light-hearted yet solemn, comprehensible yet arduous, optimistic yet depressing. For I know this world is not gonna be as acceptable as the movie wants it to be. Just look at these 1/10 reviews here. I hope Gerwig will make more movies like Barbie because I need it, we need it.', \"Barbie is a fantastic movie, it's so layered, bold and smart. Brilliant writing, directing, acting, costumes and set design wow. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are amazing in it. Also America Ferrera, what a performance (her monologue in one scene has us gagged in the cinema).Greta Gerwig created a clever, charming and fun movie that will have you laugh, smile and clap. It will also have you thinking about our individual role and place in the world. A breath of fresh air in the world of cinema and one that is needed for these challenging times we're in.Margot Robbie as Barbie was like she was born to play the role. But still, imo Ken(played by literally me) stole the show.A solid 8.\", 'Barbie was so much better than I expected it to be, I thought it would be fun but it definitely nailed everything it went for.While not taking itself seriously as a comedy, it still manages to touch on important topics like inequality. It holds up a mirror that will make some people feel uncomfortable, and this can be seen by some reviews calling it \"preachy\".The performances were so perfect for their respective characters and they did a good job of establishing everyone\\'s role in the story. The story itself had great pacing and kept you interested the whole way throughout.The great thing about Barbie is that it touches on worlds dominated by either Men or Women are both wrong, and the key is finding balance and equality. The Barbie showing opposite sides of the real world.It also had great positive masculinity, especially during the Ken fight, they could have just gone for a generic case of them fighting each others and looking like they can\\'t control themselves. Instead they had them overcome their differences and appreciate each other.I also appreciate they gave Ken a good ending too, having his character not be defined by being with Barbie, and instead being proud of just being himself. Which again, parallels the pressure on Women being defined by their partner.A certain crowd won\\'t understand any of the points made by this movie and will just call it \"preachy\" some reviews I\\'ve read on here have definitely not watched the movie.It\\'s a fun comedy that will make you laugh and also think, overall a great experience and will likely be the film of the year.', \"The script is well-written with engaging complexity, a remarkable script that transformed into an excellent film. All of the castings are top tier, I can't imagine another Barbie other than Margot. The sounds and visuals are admittedly not too prominent, but it also contributes significantly to the emotional orientation, which was done nicely. However, the film could have done better in developing the supporting characters. It's truly amazing that a film like this could do so well at the box office compared to other billion-dollar movies. And I think I'm not the only one hoping that there won't be a sequel, it's much better standing alone.\", 'It truly surprises me how greta gerwig revolutionizes the film industry, with a movie that\\'s seemingly so simple and \"childlike\" and turning it into a life lesson and still keeping the fun in it. It has so many fun elements in it but still gives off its message so clearly. How well it was filmed and directed was truly astounding to see how it was not only visually beautiful and aesthetically pleasing but also the writing and the acting. Every part of this movie was well thought out and it shows. My only critique is that the pace at the ending was a bit too fast and random but it ultimately makes sense in the movie so it\\'s excusable.', \"It seemed like they wanted the barbie movie to be bigger like have this great big message for the audience, bring a whole lotta inspirational stuff but the plot was all over the place cause of all this preaching leading nowhere. Its comedy, tragic, musical, hopeful, inspirational and the list goes on just a mess of a rollercoaster. The preaching is just cringe and too much and when you think about it, it gets hypocritical. They wanted to fit so much into this movie but it didnt flow and work together, they didn't finish the ideas they started. No sort of development to be frank. Only good thing about this movie was Ryan gosling in his role of Ken, he carried the movie and did outstanding other than... dont waste money, energy, time like just dont go at all.\", 'After having seen Oppenheimer (also reviewed) in 35MM and IMAX 70MM, I decided it was time to view the other half of Barbenheimer. With my local cinema usually being quiet, and the film having been out for weeks, I was happy to find that the screening of Barbie was almost sold out when I got one of the few tickets left, leading to me entering Barbie\\'s world.View on the film:Welcoming the audience to Barbie\\'s world (life in plastic, it\\'s fantastic) with a crane shot landing in Barbie\\'s Dreamhouse, ( with the shot fully displaying the amazing production design) co-writer (with her husband Noah Baumbach) / directing auteur Greta Gerwig & The Homesman (2014-also reviewed) cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto unbox a tantalizing fantastical atmosphere shining in a kaleidoscope of pinks and Jacques Demy- inspired bursting primary colours.Gliding across Barbieland to sparkling Musical numbers from toe-tapping tunes by Andrew Wyatt and Mark Ronson, Gerwig plays with in the land with an opening tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which merrily sets the stage for ultra-stylized paper cut montages, casting the real world in muted, grounded colours, and shimmering close-ups of Barbie dancing off with Ken.Bringing all his Kenergy to the role,Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as Ken, with Gosling visibly enjoying expressing Ken\\'s lack of self-awareness as he attempts to woo Barbie with one-liners that are left hanging in the air, whilst Michael Cera gives an adorable, awkward turn as Allan, and Will Ferrell displays (some) restrain from his now typical shouting manner, with an amusing boo-hiss turn as the Mattel CEO.Revealing in an interview that she said to the studio that because \" now you\\'ve got Barbie and Greta Gerwig,\" the film would be certain to make a Billion at the Box Office, Margot Robbie gives a magical performance in the title role, thanks to Robbie performing the dead-pan comedic one-liners in a exuberant manner, and also displaying an enticing, unshakable eagerness, blossoming when Barbie drives away from Barbieland.Leaving Barbieland behind for the first time, (leaving the familiar safety net, also being a major theme in Lady Bird) the screenplay by Gerwig and Baumbach splendidly threads very funny fish out of water set-pieces with empowering statements against toxic masculinity and casual sexism, as Barbie runs over every attempt made to force her away from a path of self-discovery, and into a small, marketable little box, by waving farewell to Barbieland.', 'I bought into the marketing hype and boy did this movie deliver! It was smart, funny, charismatic, visually pleasing and touching!It was both a perfect social commentary on the world today from a place of empathy and understanding for both men and women. From some haters online I thought it was going to be overly feminist (which I have no problem with) but I think it perfectly expressed how patriarchy is detrimental for men as well as women.But more importantly it was hilarious. Kate McKinnon stole the show, but the acting was solid all around. Really excited to see what Greta Gerwig does next-I heard this movie just surpassed $1Billion-the results speak for themselves.', 'I should be the target audience. I am a woman in her thirties that grew up playing with Barbie dolls. Malibu barbie, Stacy, Skipper, Ken and the likes.But this movie failed on so many accounts. I cannot for the life of me understand what the message of this movie is/was. What am I take away from this?Kens have more fun? No, wait, Kens have all the fun. They can be as stupid as they want and still get really cool songs to sing? (Matchbox 20 is one of my alltime favourite bands - love me some Rob Thomas) They get to take over in 48 hours, not hard at all, because Barbies actually want to be submissive and they have an actual story arc (although kinda leaning into evil territory). That this movie could have had the title Ken - and Barbies do what... ?Barbies are what? Meant to be pretty and that\\'s it? That is indeed what breaks this Barbie\\'s (camels) neck. The fact that she isn\\'t pretty anymore. And then we get this superficial \"women are so torn\" monolog in the middle of the movie that missed all the beats it was meant to hit. I am a woman. Was I meant to sympathise? It was a meaningless chain of words strung together to form more meaninglessness. Couldn\\'t have perfect Barbie pulled herself up by her bootstraps? No, she needs the mom? With her superficial observations?The Barbie I grew up with was humble. She wouldn\\'t have had this attitude of I know I am perfect, although she of course was. I was missing that too.But most of all, and I cannot emphasise how important that is: I hate that Barbie doesn\\'t get to have any fun in this movie. I hate that she doesn\\'t tell Ken in the end that she can\\'t be the one responsible for his happiness. That he has to take responsibility for his own happiness. I hate that Ken is concerned with not having genitals in front of those real world workers. It shouldn\\'t matter to him at this point in the movie (later on, okay), but even a genital-less Ken seems to be afraid of others thinking he has nothing in his pants.This is a minor quibble. But the ladies in the beginning that I want to call sturdier than any Barbie I\\'ve ever seen body wise... Were there ever such Barbies? I get that the movie wants to be inclusive, but I never got to play with overweight Barbie and I would have liked an explanation for their existence in Barbieland. Just one line would have sufficed.There\\'s so much about this movie that doesn\\'t sit well with me, but most of all - even on boring days my Barbies had way more fun than this stereotypical Barbie. She was having real adventures and that is something sorely missing from this movie. Which means I as the viewer had no real fun watching it. Instead I was trying to wrap my head around how nonesensical most of it felt to me.Like my header says - squandered potential.', \"With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think.\", \"I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint, but I have to say this movie rocks. Margot Robbie is awesome, Gerwig's direction is solid, the writing is well thought out, the colors pop, and let's not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this. His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children. I'm definitely looking forward to see where Gerwig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future.\", 'The movie that breaks all norms and once again proves that following the norm does not get you anywhere. The emotional roller coaster with a colourful palette is an absolute masterpiece of story telling with strong social messaging. The songs touch the right emotions and at times; the audience were visibly tearful. Barbie represents every one of us . All the characters shine through and the actor and the story is bold. Mattel have proved to be visionary in being bold and addressing the shortcomings of their marketing . This takes a lot of guts. The movie absolutely hammers home the point - representation matters. And there is a Barbie in each one of us.', 'Yes, it was funny. That\\'s all I thought it was. But, I\\'m 7 months pregnant with my first child, a girl, and I couldn\\'t stop crying through ANYTHING remotely touching. It was wonderful. Not too political. Just really thoughtful and sweet. Yes, it was over the top, but in a good way. Barbie and the Barbie/universe did a good job of making fun of itself, I recognized so many Barbies that I used to play with as a little girl, and I felt the feeling over again watching this movie that one gets when they start to grow up and grow out of playing with their Barbies. If you\\'ve seen Toy Story 2, it\\'s a similar feeling to that \"when she loved me\" moment. But then there are more heartfelt moments beyond that.', \"If it matters for an age perspective, I'm 32. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was disappointing. The actors did a good job with what they were given, and the Barbieland costumes and set design were great. But it was a poor storyline. Being a comedy, there were only about 3 moments that I found funny. I noticed the audience in the theater didn't laugh much either. I think the advertising for this was better than the actual film. The media really hyped this movie up and of course currently all the major headlines are rave reviews. But it's definitely not worth the hype. I know I won't ever watch this movie again.\", 'This movie is set for what women experience it\\'s a movie for the men who say \"What if the roles were reversed\" You can call this a feminist or political movie but if equality is that to you that says enough. This movie should be a reflection of men and women it\\'s not a kid\\'s movie they will not understand it but more for those who grew up watching it and playing with dolls as she was the first girl toy that went outside the mother role she is a role model to many young girls who are now women and a lesson to men who will never understand you can call me a feminist by truly women has it hard \"men hate women, women hate women\"', \"I'm a little lost as to who the target audience is.My guess would be females in their 20's because I doubt any young children will understand the preachy politics of the story.The look of the entire movie was too in-your-face. The songs and dancing were uncomfortably cringe worthy. The whole look and feel to the film was a mix of confusing and annoying at times.The only plus (and the reason I gave it a 3 and not a 1) was Ryans performance which was amusing at almost every turn. Weirdly this is the most versatile acting I've ever seen from him and ironically he was playing a plastic doll.Overall I'd avoid this film at all costs.\", 'Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought \"how did they even come up with all of this\". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It\\'s very extravagant and light and fun. It\\'s not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.In one word: iconic.', 'My 20 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much. It was adorable and funny and surprisingly heartwarming. I really think anyone would enjoy this though. It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.', 'The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.Hilarious, intelligent, beautiful, poignant, tasteful. This movie makes me warm to the knowledge of being a woman. I will be watching more Greta movies from now on if not all of them. I cried.', \"For me this is the most pointless movie I've ever watched. I really don't understand where all this hype came from. My expectations were not that high considering the type of movie, but sill I waa not prepared for this -> which is the reason why I leave my first review in IMDB.For me this movie is just milking the Barbie brand. Great cast though! The sets, the costumes, the colours - these was perfect. And the actors play so well that you actually cringe while watching :)So, should you watch it?Haha no. Don't waste your time and money, spend some time with your friends instead and buy them a drink :)\", \"Barbie was by far one of the best movies i've watched in 2023. From the acting to the costumes, it was all just so amazing. I have no words to express how i feel after watching Barbie. It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster. I hope we can see a sequel to Barbie. The movie deserves all the love. Go watch it now!!!\", \"The barbie movie is AMAZING. Like perfect cast, amazing references. Like Taylor swift level of references and Easter eggs. It's so clear that it's been made by women (or majority women) all departments, everywhere I hope it wins awards. I've never felt this way for a movie before but it defs was hyped up for a reason. It's a barbie movie made for everyone but it's not like a typical barbie movie (which I still love) it's so much more, once I heard Billie eilishes new song I knew it was gonna be GOOD and in depth with its story line and it was. The whole team and makers of this movie hit the nail on the head. It's genuinely become my favourite movie.\", \"I enjoyed this movie a lot, but there were also some parts in the storyline that didn't make sense or lacked depth.First off the things I enjoyed:\\nThe decor and colors were amazing, the music was great, the casting was incredible, weird barbie, Allan, the way barbie and Ken were completely unaware of how the world worked when they first got there, kens song, the fragments of life that barbie saw at the end.Even though many parts were good, there are parts that just lacked sense.The movie tries to make sort of a statement of mother daughter relationships, which kind of works but just not quite. The daughter character doesn't contribute much to the story, she's really just that one grumpy teenage character who turns out to have a heart after all, but it just didn't make sense in the story. Next the entire corporation storyline didn't make sense at all. In the beginning it was like fine, they try to get barbie back to barbieland, but then she goes back herself, they follow her and from that point they contribute literally nothing to the story anymore. I forgot they were there until they suddenly appeared out of the bushes. It just lacked depth and logic and in my opinion it just wasn't necessary to have made the movie to what it was.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie a lot, but some plot points just weren't what I expected them to be. Still, I would recommend this movie to a friend.\", 'I liked the inital idea where they aproach sexism thru barbie, the oldes concept of feminism that actually took a opposite turn. But, the point was neither here nor there, and I felt like it changed as the movie continued. The ending was whole another story and not well put together with the rest of the plot. I found the characters too romantic, poetic and naive. The parts that I did like was ryan goslings acting, some parts of his character were pretty funny. Also, the musical numbers were great and I liked the costumes and props. Also, the idea of life in barbieland is kind of funny and amusing.', 'I Love this one so much!! Movie of the year!!! Most men here will criticize and give it a bad grade, but you have no idea how much a film like this can touch the heart of every mother, daughter and girl who loves Barbie dolls in the whole world, it is moving to watch all of this, besides that final scene only serves to show the struggle that women have always suffered their whole lives and that their daughters and those who will come in the future will suffer. A film that sends such an important message is extremely important to us. I laughed and cried so much, was such a lovely experience, i wish i could watch again but this time with my mom.', \"I'm a single guy. I studied a little gender roles while I was in college, and actually went to the movie with 3 of my best friends I made from that course. I was really optimistic about the movie.Personally as the title suggests the movie felt rushed. There are some parts and themes in the movie that are really well-developed, and some parts that are just overwhelmingly bad, including some of the larger arguments about gender roles found throughout the movie.A lot of the film is saved by the fact it is played out in a way where they're from a set of a little girls play house, so a lot of critiques can be overlooked.I didn't go in wanting to hate this movie. I wanted to see a movie of the caliber of its star-studded cast, but it was bit of a let down to me.\", \"This is the first movie I've ever watched that I cannot stop thinking about. The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan.\", \"I don't know if I've ever seen anything quite like Barbie, which is rewarding if you ask me, especially since I haven't been this excited for any other release this year. So what did I think of it?For starters, I really admire the production of this movie. Gorgeous does not begin to describe the sets, and it's commendable how well they highlight the surrealism of Barbieland. I had seen a YouTube video exploring Barbie's Dreamhouse and already concluded in my mind that it was pretty great, but seeing it in the context of the movie just made it better. The costumes are great too.Furthermore, the acting is alright! Huge props to Margot Robbie. The movie blends humour and angst with some other tonal elements, which means that it demands more from the actors than you would assume at first. The ensemble cast was obviously up to the task, but something in their performances caught my attention. I vaguely remember Gerwig mentioning in an interview the issue of considering the technicalities of a typical Barbie's movements. You can notice several points in the movie where the actors embrace the stiff and wooden movements of a doll, but at other less noticeable or relevant moments, they're as flexible as a living entity whilst in Barbieland. I don't know how one would navigate a perfectly adequate balance between the two, but my brain couldn't ignore this mild inconsistency, whether you consider it important or not (and I do). The film did utilize this for comedic effect though, and I thought that was a nice touch.While there are more things I like than dislike about this movie, I feel like the execution leaves something to be desired. The first act of the movie is everything I'd hoped it would be; campy, funny, and exceedingly pink. I love that even the subsequent scenes in Barbieland embrace this quirkiness, irrespective of the stakes. However, the transition from Barbie and Co's everyday shenanigans to her journey of awareness and self-discovery felt a bit... sudden? While it aptly gives focus to the main conflict of the movie, I feel like the heavy marketing of the movie had already given away too many glimpses of Barbieland before I saw the film. It took away the element of wonder and left the superficial part of me a little disappointed. Also, the final two-thirds of the movie is just shy of overstimulating. I hate to say it, but the reinforcement of women empowerment ideals isn't done tastefully and comes off harsher than it should, and the sharp tonal change preceding it doesn't help. The exploration of switched gender roles from Barbieland to the real world was another clever idea whose execution lacked finesse. This made Ryan Gosling's Ken briefly unlikeable to me; he saved the performance with his undeniable charisma and sense of humour. And even though I thought the ending was a nice surprise (that scene with the Billie Eilish number is one of the most beautiful things ever), I was sadly distracted by the non-subtlety of the preceding events, however funny or thoughtful they were. Perhaps I would appreciate it better with a second watch.So yeah, Barbie is an experience. Tune in for the colourful heaps of fun, and stay for the emotional and humanistic themes. But beware of the untidy edges.\", \"Spoilers Ahead - Firstly Ryan Gosling was the only good thing about this film. The stupid thing is when Barbie went to the real world she hated how there were a lot of males in leadership positions, even though in Barbie Land it is entirely run by females and then wonders why Ken wanted to change things in Barbie land when she felt the same way as ken in the real world. This lead to ken being the villain and no it was not Will Ferrel character as the bad guy as he wanted to keep barbie land the way it was not to have ken take over so it was in fact ken to believed to be the bad guy. Then the really stupid thing comes at the end when she fights hard to change her home back into barbie land then decides to go and live in the real world which she hated because of the male dominance. Also the whole female don't have power thing is getting a bit old as these days there are strong powerful woman in successful leadership jobs.\", 'Really good soundtracks and amazing cast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were incredible. The jokes were funny too. I also liked the little details in the movie, like Barbie\\'s iconic clothes, or the matrix reference back with weird barbie. But the story and overall everything wasn\\'t as exceptionally good and enjoyable as everybody promises, especially if we compare it to the quantity of hype and advertising it got. Also, I wasn\\'t, and I\\'m still not sure what audiences it is for. Sure, they say \"It\\'s for everybody\", but no, I don\\'t think it\\'s for everybody. Shortly, worth to watch, but definitely not a Godfather.', \"Barbie is such a fun time, the whole cast collectively deserve an award. Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more. I can't believe a movie like this got such a huge budget and is such a success.\", \"I didn't have a lot of big expectations for this movie, so imagine how happy and surprised I was about how much I enjoyed it! It's silly, and fun and then BOOM- existentialism! While I wouldn't recommend this movie for under 10- there's A LOT of innuendo that will probably go over many younger viewers heads, but there are a couple parts that might not be best for the littles, IMO. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is a lot deeper than one would expect! Margot Robbie is a delight, as is Ryan Gosling. The entire cast is wonderful! Issa Rae never disappoints and her role as President Barbie! A truly fun summer movie!\", 'I love that this film incorporates comedy and realism into it. I also like the fact that it wasn\\'t entirely about Barbie and woman, but also about men and that they also have feelings and emotions. As a 15 year old girl, this made me think about what its like from my mother perspective in life, and that no matter, what they will always support us in what we want to be or dream to be. Coming out of the theatre, a whirlwind of emotions flooded my mind. Glorias speech made me realise that even though the world and people demand us to be perfect doesn\\'t mean we have to achieve those demands, we need to find ourselves and love ourselves before we love anyone or let anyone love us. I understand that men feel as though Ken deserved a bit of leadership ad power, but the Barbies built that land. Us woman love this movie because it opens up our imagination of what we can be, and though people says \" Oh, they could\\'ve let the Ken\\'s have a bit of ownership and power\" But when Barbie went to the real world, you could see from most women\\'s perspective of what their life is like on a daily basis \\'not saying all men are like this stereotype\\'. Barbieland gives young girls the motivation and the idea that they CAN be a president, a construction worker, an astronaut, an they can be weird. I understand that people hav their different opinions, and this is just mine.', \"It's a shame because I love Little Women and Lady Bird. Barbie did not serve.It's a long ramble about how matriarchy is perfect and patriarchy is stupid. I'm agreeing with the latter, but the execution is just awful. The CEO and corporate people of Mattel started as a mock to men having all the top positions of a company, as the movie goes they're just there at the back of your mind and it's unpleasant experience because they did not do anything after. So many unnecessary scenes that could've been meaningful. For example, what's the scene Allan fighting other Kens for? There are so many seeds planted at once but none of them grew into their fullest potential. Here are some examples:1. The mother and daughter relationship: It started well, the daughter is disconnected with her mother. You thought the movie will revolve about fixing that problem? No. The daughter has no problem. She's just a teenager.2. Mother's longing for her daughter: The reason why barbie became curious about death is because the mother is playing with her barbie *differently*. She's drawing *weird* (sigh) Barbies. You thought it was because she had a rough childhood and now is the time to heal her inner child? No, she misses her time playing with her daughter. While it is an alright backstory, I see no reason how it is related to Barbie getting curious on death.3. Patriarchy: It's always shown that patriarchy is for stupid men and their horses. The corporate people who are all men tries to catch Barbie so they can send her back to Barbieland. But barbie went to Barbieland and they STILL FOLLOWED HER. It took them too long to get there for no apparent reason. And when they get there it just gets very confusing. Why are they in there?4. Barbie wanting to be human: This should've been the theme of the movie. The point of the movie should've been about what Barbie saw to make her realize she wants to be human. But no, it was only a few minutes when she's seeing people laughing and some people are sad. After that, there was no more of it. They tried to push this in the ending but it just doesn't feel right because of the lack of motivation. Although it was expected. They wasted the whole time with cameos and other meaningless scenes.I am disappointed in this movie. It's not worth the hype.\", \"Watching Greta Gerwig's interpretation of womanhood through universal icon, Barbie, was a beautiful and uniting experience.This movie celebrates the transition from girlhood to womanhood, as well as the universal experience of just existing in this day and age.Not to mention the filming techniques used to film alongside the soundtrack and even the cast made the movie feel like a trip back to playtime in childhood.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have so much on screen chemistry that makes the movie feel fluid and fun, and the insanely diverse cast of both Barbies and Kens was an astounding and commendable casting choice.Barbie is definitely Oscar worthy, and represents something much more than a doll.\", 'I loved Barbie as a child, so when my teenage daughter wanted to go see it at the premiere, I was on!The movie started out great, and I really enjoyed the first part with all the funny details, and I loved that they made sure to also include a lot of the most hilarious discontinued Barbie products.The silly and perfect take on barbieland with the amazing actress Margot Robbie playing \"stereotypical barbie\" was hitting ALL the right notes, and I couldn\\'t wait till she was introduced to the hard reality of the \"real world\".Sadly this is where the innovative and creative vibe ends, as the \"real world\" is just as (if not even more) silly and unrealistic than Barbieland - presenting an extreme reality where unintelligent powerhungry men completely run the world and not one single women is able the have any job of significance.Making the entire thing even worse, atleast the last 45 mins of the movie is the morale of.. well.. everything..To be honest ive never been a big fan of Ryan Gosling, and sadly his role as \"Ken\" didn\\'t help. It wasn\\'t really funny, just sad, and the big moment when the barbies was fighting back wasn\\'t really him realising he was wrong, just that him and the other \"Kens\" couldn\\'t really do anything about the fact that the women had taken over barbieland, and they just gave up?All in all \"Barbie\" was a great idea, with a great cast, and it\\'s obvious that they had done their homework when it came to the history of barbie. Sadly it ended up as quite a mess, as the story didn\\'t make any sense - leaving me with a lot of questions.', \"More could you want from a movie? How about Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Hari Nef all playing Barbie variations, like Weird Barbie, President Barbie, and Doctor Barbie. Plus, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and Ncuti Gatwa are all playing Kens. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the company who first brought us Barbie and her Dreamhouse. The film focuses on what happens when the perfect doll has an existential crisis, and Mattel's pursuit to stop Barbie from changing the real world forever. Greta Gerwig ('Lady Bird') directs a script she co-wrote with partner and fellow filmmaker Noah Baumbach ('Marriage Story'). Drop by the Dreamhouse in your pink convertible when the movie premieres in July 2023.\", 'Went with my friend to see Barbie for her birthday and now we\\'re both having existential crises about being woman and growing up.I knew Barbie was going to be a laugh. I knew it was going to be a little emotional. But what i didn\\'t expect was for it to completely rip my heart out and stick it back in my chest!Greta Gerwig has a truly beautiful soul and she has a very unique way of expressing that that really resonates with me and many other people especially women. She always knows how to pull off that intense third act monologue about being a woman that hits you right in your soul and causes you to rethink everything.I have never seen a movie that explains how exhausting it is to be a woman not only around men, but around other women. America Ferrera, who plays Gloria, has a insanely heartfelt beautiful monologue where she says \"i\\'m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us\" and i have never felt something deeper in my heart.Never thought i\\'d say this but this movie absolutely changed my life and i will love it for life.', \"The Barbie movie is an absolute delight! It captivates audiences with its fantastic songs, creating a truly enchanting experience. The fun and engaging story will keep you hooked from start to finish, and the clever humor ensures there are plenty of laughs throughout the film. Plenty of Ken and Barbie for everyone. Makes everyone feel like they have a part to play. It's a must-watch for all ages, as it beautifully brings the beloved Barbie character to life in a way that leaves a lasting impression. Don't miss out on this enjoyable and mesmerizing cinematic adventure! Also, there is nothing after the end credits.\", \"The most political movie I have ever watched. It is so confusing that you can't be sure what its target audience is. It looks like they wanted it to be profound, but putting too much 'woke' content made it boring and cringe. As a woman, I honestly felt quite uncomfortable seeing how all the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid and shallow human beings.Overall, 4/10 for good acting, good music, and good costumes.I went to watch this movie as I heard it is not just an easy going entertaining one like everybody was expecting but touching and deep. I was curious. And I walked out of the cinema hall wishing that this movie was that simple as expected.\", \"The Barbie movie is a such a sweet, fun movie. And absolutely hilarious. The whole theater was laughing. We laughed. We cried and we all danced. But we were lucky to have the best crowd at our showing which made the experience that much more enjoyable! So I highly recommend that you go to a good area to watch it. The people around can either make or break the sweet experience. It has been a long time since I've watched a movie that was actually clean and fun. The story is so entertaining. And the ending was absolutely amazing. The writers did an amazing job and the cast was absolute perfect in every way! God watch it. But get in your Barbie glam first!\", 'First off, I will look at the positive aspects. Margot played a beautiful Barbie. Not only was she pretty, her acting skills shined. However, I felt that the message conveyed here was poor, inappropriate, or unnecessary. I left the theater not feeling great about myself or the world. I did not enjoy how they had to put Ken down to make Barbie better, perhaps that is not what we should do, perhaps we should make everyone better.There were several clever references to pop culture that I thought were good. But perhaps they should have pop culture references that people seeing Barbie would like.', \"It was a really fun and re-watchable movie. It had some really relevant messages - the only negative is that it felt the movie couldn't decide how it was going to deliver those messages. It almost felt like 2 directors were on set- 1 that wanted a whimsical movie that didn't take itself seriously and one that wanted the movie to be social commentary and they thumb wrestled at the beginning of each scene to determine who directed it.I feel like the CEO/Mattel goons were unnecessary to the movie and Barbie's decision at the end was out of the blue and seemed to wrap up too quickly\\nOverall, though, a really creative film that I will buy on digital to watch repeatedly.Margot and Ryan were brilliant along with Simu Liu being a standout when he was on screen.\", 'The \"Barbie Movie\" brings to life the beloved doll in a delightful and empowering animated adventure that will enchant audiences of all ages. Directed by a talented team, the film embraces the essence of Barbie\\'s timeless charm while weaving a heartwarming tale that inspires and entertains. From the opening scene, the film captures attention with its vibrant and enchanting animation. The world of Barbie is beautifully realized, boasting breathtaking landscapes, colorful settings, and meticulously designed characters. The attention to detail in every frame adds depth to the storytelling, immersing viewers into Barbie\\'s fantastical universe.', 'I had high expextations for this Movie: Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, Perfect Casting, Ryan Gosling and then the First Trailer: Our hopes for this beeing something special were high. Yesterday, I saw the movie. It was so great, just so great, My God. Ken is just it. He is just it. Kenough said. You Just Need to buy a ticket, or two and go See it. Some people might Not understand the Movie, maybe your friends or family sitting next to you dont like it. But that is okay.

I went to see it just for the sake that this is the first movie of a kind and I thought there will be some valuable content somehow, but this was such a waste of time. Dont waste your time and money to see this move, its not worth it! Such a dissapointment from Margot Robi and Ryan Gosling to star in something this stupid and shlallow. They could've make something better with the story and the acting, this was amateur level completely. The scenery in Barbieland was nive though, I beleive every girl will see something she owned when she was little. Not recommended!!!\", 'This movie is absolutely amazing! It totally makes you think about the current society and what we really do prioritise and favour. Went into it without knowing what sort of angle they would take, and I was so extremely surprised and pleased with how Greta has done this. I can truthfully say I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, however there was times where tears were also shed due to the meaning of the film. Casting was a brilliant choice, Margot was the perfect fit for Barbie and Ryan a great Ken. Also want to mention that America and Kate did awesome jobs with their characters. A must watch, possibly best movie of the year!', \"Even though gosling gives ken such of a good play. This movie was to peachy. Really not good in my opinion but it was a good movie to sleep to. And my five year old daughter was so happy to see the movie and she loved the popcorn. And the ending was amazing to be a bad movie. I'd say the movie is good in the beginning but it's still badly written and the plot isn't good enough to make a movie like this one or something else that I think is better in that regard and it's not that good at the same level of story but it still makes it a great film to see and see and it is worth a watch and I don't know if.\", \"Doesn't seem to matter what I do I'm always number two No one knows how hard I tried, oh-oh, I I have feelings that I can't explain Drivin' me insane All my life, been so polite But I'll sleep alone tonight 'Cause I'm just Ken Anywhere else, I'd be a ten Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blond fragility?

Gerwig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender, demonstrating that Kens in Barbieland face similar challenges as real-world women. The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie\\'s production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera\\'s character brings a layer of relatability to the story. Gerwig\\'s clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience. A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience.', 'Barbie was a big surprise for me, I enjoyed every sip of this delicious pink drink that teleports you to a bright world where imagination is real and reality is just a tiny dreamland nowhere and everywhere. The production design was out of this world and the casting of this movie was perfect, every frame was shot and directed beautifully, in general, the technical aspect was brilliant. Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.', \"Barbie starts off with a promising blend of satire and clever dialogue, but as the story transitions into the real world, the film becomes tiresome and less captivating. Like oil and water, it attempts to provide entertainment but is hindered by heavy-handed messages. It is not your typical children's film; instead, it feels more like a production geared towards teenagers, laden with political propaganda and mockery of traditional values.The film seems intent on conveying a manifesto against a cruel and unrealistic reality while addressing the existential crisis faced by women. However, for male viewers like myself, the film feels peculiar and confusing due to its irrelevant and comical political undertones.It also appears to take on the role of a feminist campaign, attempting to portray women as equal to men through ironic and puzzling means. Unfortunately, some of the intended messages get lost in translation and lack proper delivery. The perplexing ending, where Barbie's creator claims she can choose her destiny, as if referring to a tragedy as a gift, only adds to the overall confusion and lack of clarity regarding Barbie's origins.Perhaps with the addition of more appropriate dialogue, this plastic doll movie could have been an enjoyable watch, instead of morphing into a misguided attempt to indoctrinate children with politics.\", 'I loved the opening sequence of the film and knew it was going to be a fun ride there on out. And it was! It\\'s not \"political\", yes it does talk about the hardships and stereotypes women face, but it\\'s weird that anyone would be upset by that?! The set designs and camp were beyond entertaining and some of the scenes were so out of this world and hilarious. The only reason I don\\'t give it a full ten stars is that I do agree the ending fell a little flat for me, in that I thought everyone in Barbieland would be a little more equal. But, a small miss in an otherwise successful movie. Just go see it!', 'I had my reservations going in due to the fact that this was directed by \"mumblecore\" maestro Gerwig, who was last seen modernising little women to ensure a more feminist ending, but the trailers gave the impression of a fun dish out of water, Elf Meeta enchanted vibe.Instead we got an extended diatribe against men for two hours, albeit amidst some funny scenes and lovely set design. Watching empowered, millionaire actors, writers and directors scream about their oppression by all men is not entertaining, and I found it sad later to see all the excited little.girls waiting to see the next show, to know that they are going to spend the afternoon essentially being told of the evils of their Dads, sitting next to them in the screen!', 'Begrudgingly, I took my granddaughter and her friend to this movie, who dressed in high heels and pink checkered dresses to match the one Barbie wears in the movie. They looked adorable. It was really good. Not one of my top 10 best ever, movies. But not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I particularly liked the \"KEN\" dance, although the two teenyboppers beside me laughed all the way through the scene. Personally I think Ryan Gosling carried the movie, and the only thing that kept me entertained. He was excellent. I asked the girls if they know what the overall message of the movie was about, and both said \"No\" rather nonchalantly. I asked what was there best part, and both said, \"I don\\'t know\", what was your least favourite part? \"I don\\'t know\". Did you like the movie, and both said \"Yes\". I thought the messaging was good for an adult, but it went over the heads of the young teens.', \"Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig is one of the most anticipated movies of 2023. From the first photos on set to the huge marketing, barbie promised a colourful set and dreamy background where the pastel aesthetic is a fundamental factor. It delivers amazing performances from the whole cast, Robbie and Gosling with unmatched chemistry, Ferrera's monologue and everybody else.The message is clear, how it is to be a woman in this reality, a mother, a daughter.. feminism seems superficial but it gives a powerful insight on the matter. Greta managed to tell us how impactful Barbie has been to little girls who dream of being whatever they want but she also criticises how damaging the doll can be to self-conscious girls.She exploits the famous figure to make fun of the patriarchy. At first it can be interpreted as a product of capitalism and stereotypes but you'll understand that the same Barbie is criticised in the movie for these same themes. This judgment is already solved in the message of the movie, Greta flips this concept using it to tell the story and its moral.It's camp, it's fun and it's pop.The script is smart and well written, it makes you laugh and sing and dance but all of it is balanced with profound conversation, Barbie and Ruth Handler, and with the amazingly and hurtfully sincere monologue by Gloria (Ferrera). There's a handful of cinema references, from Kubrick's 2001: space odyssey to The Wizard of Oz, there are jokes on movies that aren't to be taken to seriously, you'll find them funny.Jokes on fascism that are culturally genius and a rupture of the fourth wall that you'll absolutely agree with.It's not only a feminist message but Barbie expands its themes to Ken's character. The difficulty to found his own identity, to be someone outside of his shadow (his barbie).This film is demential and intelligent, an adaptation of the loveable doll, you can have fun with it but also write a whole essay about its moral and heart.\", \"I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Barbie, but this was bad. An awful plot with some very unnecessary sequences, and it feels far too preachy to be an enjoyable movie. There is a good movie in there somewhere, but it is buried underneath unnecessary characters and preachy dialogue. I personally would not recommend watching this in theaters, if I hadn't been watching it with my friends (so that we could joke about how bad it was) I would have felt that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. Of course, maybe this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Other than the poor plot, I thought that the acting was done reasonably well, about what you would expect with the cast of the movie, and there were a few funny moments sprinkled in there as well.\", 'This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to \"apologize\" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again.', \"This movie is not only an actually funny comedy with an amazing script and good jokes, but a seriously intense story of womanhood, girlhood and motherhood that portrayed how much the patriarchy affects everyone. As a girl, this movie resonated with me and every single line about being a girl in this world hit me hard, but it was so beautiful. I've seen men say that this movie was 'feminist garbage' or 'over-exaggerated' but it honest to god wasn't. Not only this, but while being a movie that accurately represents the feeling of not knowing who you are or what you are going to be (aka girlhood) it was pro-men and not in a bad way. Somehow, a movie so strongly empowering women also gave men feeling and hurt. This made the movie so honest and just good. I could go on for hours about how much this movie means to me, and that it's something with messages that will stick with me forever.With all this being said, it was funny as hell and my whole theater was dying at some of the jokes made 😭 they did not hold back.\", \"There was a lot of hype leading up to this movie, because of the cast and simply because it's a movie about Barbie. This movie 100% backed up it's hype. This was a very funny movie with a great storyline. I am going to be honest, I was not expecting it to be that good of a storyline and it truly was.It was a weirdly funny movie that also had good morals and a great message behind it. Ryan Gosling stole the show and cracked up the audience basically every-time he appeared on the screen (along with Will Ferrell of course)\\nMargot Robbie did a phenomenal job as Barbie. Overall it was an amazing watch and no reason this movie should receive any hate!\", 'Firstly, whoever rates this movie below 10 is an empty man or a woman without sense of sensitivity and beauty. This film depicts the harsh truth women must live with, which is that this is \" a man\\'s world\". Not a very pleasant fact when your nature gravitates towards unity, happiness, femininity, not war and power. However, the ending is inspiring and masking the saddening patriarchal reality we are trapped into, therefore you don\\'t leave the cinema being depressed.Thank you Greta Gerwig, how much the little girl in me needed the comfort this masterpiece offers, i cannot put into words. Being a woman can be \"very Barbie\" with the right mindset and sanity but in this life\\'s busyness you need a reminder sometimes.Thank you to every person who put an effort into creating this 2 hour lesson.', 'So many positive messages for women and men alike! Barbie has an existential crisis and Ken embraces the worst of the patriarchy. Both just seeking deeper meaning - what were they made for? Meaningful subtext while being wildly entertaining!All the acting was just delightful! Ryan Gosling even steals the show - though every performance was spot on. Thanks to Greta Gerwig and Mattel for an innovative, thought provoking, gloriously vibrant extravagant movie watching experience. It is destined to be a classic.Even better, it has stirred up controversy that hopefully can lead to discourse on the themes embedded in something with such great entertainment value.', \"This movie has fun aesthetics, and fun costumes, and sometimes funny moments, definitely great actors, but the whole ideological feminist spin Greta Gerwig did in the plot ruins the entire thing, honestly, and turns a movie that could have been super fun into a bland and boring one. I thought the whole point in society is for us to be equal, not to condemn either gender or portay either gender as ruling society, like why does the male gender not own houses, why are they portayed as disposable and not taken into account, and it the end, they still don't get houses? Also this is a misrepresentation of the real world, as a woman with a career and decent income, I can tell you I in fact have more privilege than some of my male colleagues. Instead of portaying equality, the movie ends on a note where the male species is dumb and still not on equal footing. Disappointing.\", 'The entire film I was thinking \"Literally me.\" It is a perfect movie in every way, the choreography was absolutely stunning it was fantastic. This movie beats out Oppenheimer in every way possible, me and the boys pulled up to Barbie excited! Will Ferrell was pretty good too as well as all the actors. The Kens dancing as well as all the horses brought tears to my eyes. Also the best part I have to say is at the very end the Barbie song by Ice Spice it slapped I had to watch the credits just to listen to the song. 10/10 would recommend. This film was perfect in every way down to each and every frame.', \"This movie was such a fun watch, the comedy (especially by Ryan Gosling) carried the film for me. However the deeper meaning of the movie wasn't lost either.Pros: comedy, production/costume, dialogue, acting, casting, the use of Barbie merchandise, culture and nostalgia, music and dancing, cinematographyCons: some parts were stretched, the ending could've been delivered better, Will Ferrell was a good addition but it was also not needed, the seriousness of the movie got lost in the comedy at some points where you weren't sure how to feel.Overall, I think this movie was a fun watch and I'd probably watch it again.\", \"I literary searching for the answer for 2 hours movie long, I got nothing.I don't get what's the point of view to watch this, a history of barbie? History of Mattel? Why barbie land going like that repeat each day? Why Ken exist? Why barbie land connecting to real world?The character developing is so confusing as well, what's the board of directors want by chasing to the barbie land? Sasha is rejecting barbie, then wants to help barbie at the end? Mother likes barbie and make some Nostalgia, but then rejecting barbie? Ken likes barbie, then wants to learn for patriarch, then revolting barbie land?What is really going on in the writer's head?\", \"This movie is excellent. Funny & brilliant throughout.Margot Robbie is sensational. Ryan Gosling is excellent. The script is superb. The visuals are incredible. The outfits are spectacular. The music is fabulous. The dance scenes are fun! All the details from the pink slide through to the nods to all the retired Barbie friends are so wondrous & nostalgic. It's truly truly a brilliant movie.A week after seeing it I'm still thinking about it.When was the last time people dressed up to see a film?!It's a truly remarkable movie. And deserving of a multitude of Oscars.Stop reading reviews and just watch it.\", \"Boring uninteresting movie, it was fun at the beginning but the on going topic about feminism ruined the movie, felt unnecessarily long. Don't really recomend.It's good in the beginning and the experience it's not terrible, don't like the fact it's too long and you end up getting bored. Ken plays a role but it's overly complicated and annoying don't really know how this is rated as a good movie. Most like a 5/10 movie that you shouldn't watch at the cinema.Finally don't enjoy watching it at the big screen, RX and other cinematography was mid and don't look like a worth it movie to watch or invest time and money.\", \"This movie was an absolute hoot at my screening! A week after it's release, my theater was packed with people, laughing and clapping throughout the whole film. It was a great experience, and I really enjoyed the movie. Michael Cera was probably my favorite actor along with Ryan gosling and surprisingly Kate McKinnon. The story and adventure was really fun, I was absolutely in love with the visuals throughout the film, and I thought the self awareness was really refreshing. The music also energized the film throughout. With all that being said, I did have two complaints. The first is that the conclusion of the movie is that men and women can't work together, and I think that was a really strange choice. I understand that the movie wanted to empower independence but collaboration is also very important. Second complaint, why the heck was there a Chevrolet commercial in the middle of the movie? Anyways loved the movie and can't wait to see what Greta Gerwig does next.\", 'I saw this movie with my wife and daughter today and all of us agreed this was a fantastic movie. There were very progressive messages for children. I love the 2001 space odyssey intro.The acting was superb and there was a lot of great attention to detail by the cinematography crew. The soundtrack was catchy and my daughter loves the Dua Lupa and Billy Eilish songs. There were several laugh out loud moments. It seems like everyone, both adult and child were thoroughly entertained. I would recommend this movie to both adult and children. I would also recommend seeing it on the big screen to capture all the details.', \"The comedy was ok at times. Otherwise, this movie has a modern political agenda, and this is probably one of the reasons why it is highly rated. I understand the need for awareness of women's rights, possibilities, and freedom. It's here even in the 21st century, especially in some countries. However, I'm not sure if movies like this could succeed in giving the good message, or make it even worse, as sometimes the movie is disgustingly misandrous. Not to say that the overall experience of the content was not like a movie, but more of a parody of a movie. I love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but this piece is definitely overrated.\", \"Honestly, this is the best movie I've ever seen. The roles are so perfectly played and everyone did such a good job on this movie. I love it so much, came with a bunch of friends, my mom, their moms, and my little sister. Everyone said that they lived the movie. The ending made me cry but in such a good way, like how Barbie was when she experienced sadness for the first time. Seeing a movie that doesn't have the patriarchy spreader all over it is so refreshing, and honestly, if you're mad at this movie, you might be part of the problem. Seeing Ruth appear and give Barbie a talk was so amazing and such an emotional experience. I loved it so much I can't even explain. Seeing women even in movies come together and address problems is so refreshing.When the mom gave the speech about being a mom and a woman was so amazing and it had such a good message written into it.And can we talk about how well Will Ferrell played his role? And don't even get me started on Margot's acting. Literally amazing, she played her role so wellThis movie was a cinematic masterpiece to say nothing more. At the end when Barbie said her name (Barbara) was so amazing because she was originally named after Ruth's daughter, I loved that so much.And honestly I think that everybody needs to see this movie, no matter what your standpoint on life is, everyone needs to see this movie.And seeing a movie describe and mention how harmful the patriarchy is in such a funny way was absolutely amazing. I could go on and on about how good this movie made me feel but I would be here all day.It was such a good movie and I would definitely watch it again. Such a good watch.\", \"Anyone who says the movie is good is undoubtedly a Barbie fan; It is a film with a poor script, filled with a lot of padding, sometimes somewhat absurd, but which is necessary to be able to meet the duration of the film and nothing more. The social representation of the main characters is disappointing, belittling both the female and male gender on many occasions and with a slightly distorted conceptualization of common thinking. In relation to the characters, one or the other rescues the development of the film due to its trajectory on the big screen, but nothing exceptional. This is without a doubt a film that I would not see again on any given Sunday while I rest; Even if I'm being honest, it's on my list of the worst movies I've seen in my last 15 years, but be the witness yourself. In short, I can say that it is a film with great marketing management, whose work team deserves a big applause.\", \"Originally when I went into the cinema my expectations were quite low however I was pleasantly surprised. Everything from the set, the dances, the music, the costumes and the actors were phenomenal. Credit to Ryan Gosling, he fulfilled his role as Ken so well and his interactions with Margot Robbie were top notch. I loved the amount of secret cameos that went into when making this movie. This piece of media will go down in history as it has been so well done and the message(s) in it were very much prevalent. I couldn't be happier, I adore this movie and I cannot wait to watch it again at home.\", \"This movie was so emotionally moving in a way that I didn't expect at all. I loved how critically it evolves around the Barbie and Ken figure and questions everything you ever took for granted in a very nice and intelligent way. I absolutely loved this movie and would watch it again any time.I sobbed for most half of the movie, at the end it comes down to why it's important to be a human and not trying to be perfect.The cast was also amazing. Great acting. Almost all of the cast of sex education is in it which was really cool to see. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't like or didn't play with Barbie.\", 'This movie was awful and definitely not kid friendly. It turned a beautiful childhood toy and turned it into a horrid mess. It wasnt funny or entertaining. Any hope for entertainment was lost immediately. Any innocence that was held by barbie was quickly abandoned by the creators. The fact that mattel allowed for such sexual references and cursing is truly beyond me. Yes this is supposed to be barbie going to the real world and figuring out how life actually is, however it could have been done in a way where what she stands for was gracefully held intact. Instead of letting barbie go into the real world and face independence as she stands for instead of gross references to genitalia would be a start for a better movie.', \"I had to watch this movie twice. The first time, we missed the first 5 minutes, and the whole movie was confusing and I left feeling bewildered and disappointed. Then I read a review by Michael Knowles, and I realized I missed something very crucial at the start. My teenaged daughter and I went back, and we watch it from the beginning. This is a very clever movie. The layers of cleverness become very apparent when you look beyond the surface. It is a story of current society- and the ills that plague us.I think, at first, everyone is concerned about the audience for the movie- it is definitely not meant for younger kids. But it is rated PG-13- I'd say the innuendo is a bit much for 13, but it may just go right over their heads. Ultimately, I think this movie has been very misjudged by a lot of critics. It is way deeper than Barbie maybe should be, but it is great for adults who don't like what they see in our current state of existence.\", \"This movie had so much potential!! It was doing so well for a while, it was funny and clever and had depth and I was super excited to see where it was going to go, but then it just became disappointing with a really underwhelming and incoherent (even problematic) conclusion. I'm almost angry at it. Even pure shallow entertainment would have been better than planting all these seeds, making you believe they will grow into something and then just letting them die.Btw it's definitely not for under 12s. There is nothing inappropriate in it, so they could technically watch it for the visual aspect, they just wouldn't understand much.------ SPOILERS ------Some of the elements where the movie deeply disappointed me are below. Please don't read any further if you haven't watched the film yet and want these elements to be a surprise.Ken's development:Ken realises that men aren't treated as equals in Barbieland, and creates his own patriarchy, which in the end the Barbies tear down. When Ken bursts into tears thinking that he will have to go back to a life where he is oppressed - that could have been developed and executed so beautifully! Barbie even told him it's ok to cry. This could have moved towards all Kens understanding that they need to express their vulnerable emotions in order to not be angry and toxic, and the Barbies need to stop the oppression of men because it's just as bad as oppressing anyone, and it could have led to equality in Barbieland! But no. Turns out Ken is in fact crying because he has an unhealthy, anxious attachment to Barbie and his ego can't take the news that Barbie is not 'in love' with him. And then the movie concludes with Ken agreeing to explore who he is individually without Barbie (this would be an ok conclusion if it wasn't for abandoning all the other deeper seeds planted before), with some other Kens getting middle management jobs in the (once again) matriarchal Barbieland society, but not leadership positions, 'the same way it is for women in the real world'. Seriously? It's like this was written by men. The Barbies are going for revenge??Barbie's development:Barbie wants to be human, and again this could have been developed with emotional and intellectual depth, and there is an attempt at the beginning to show the reason Barbie started to have these thoughts, where she is seeing humans express all these complex emotions, and she's seeing the beauty of the world around her in all those small magical details in nature that feel more intense than usual, but then this thread is dropped completely, so much so that in the end when Barbie is asking to be human, it doesn't make sense why, and the narrator has to literally do a voiceover speech to explain it (badly). And then when she is finally human, her first (and very overhyped) trip is to the gynaecologist, implying that what she's most excited about being human is having a vagina. Again, written by men?? This movie is literally setting women back 50 years.Development of the mother - daughter relationship:Not much to say other than how shallow this remains despite setting it up as if it was going to go somewhere. Barbie goes to the real world to find this teenage girl whose emotions are causing her to malfunction (the malfunctioning focused on cellulite which is a whole other horror story!) It then turns out it's actually the girl's mum who is playing with Barbie and feeling these emotions because her life isn't fun and her daughter is hostile with her. And then at some point out of nowhere the mother and daughter start hugging and smiling at each other. That's it. We're not going into why she was hostile in the first place and why she isn't any more (teenagers are not hostile for no reason), we're not touching on why the mum was feeling that way and what made her not feel that way any more (it clearly wasn't just her daughter). But everything is suddenly fine now. Oh ok then.Allan:This is so chaotic, I don't even know where to start. So he has a particularly sensitive / gay / queer vibe, and I think they are trying to make him into a hero (like he fights a bunch of Kens for no apparent reason - they really could have used that scene for something else), but the point of him is unclear. He's an ally to the Barbies, and there's only one of him (which I always think is actually a bit problematic, to have only one token representative of the LGBTQ+ community in a film; although I get that in real life Mattel didn't have that much diversity and they were trying to stay true to that). His motivation siding with the Barbies in the patriarchy seems to be the fact that he feels invisible too, but the movie doesn't go into this at all, and kind of ignores him the same way the characters do. Like he's a hero simply by being different from the Kens and helping the Barbies, but how he feels throughout this, and what he gets out of it in the end, if anything, is anyone's guess. It's not clear whether or how things change for him at all. They don't seem to, despite all the effort.'Weird' Barbie:When Barbies are played with too hard, they turn 'weird' - strange make up and clothes, cut and messed up hair, always in splits. So far, very funny. But why does 'Weird' Barbie remain perceived weird throughout?? Why doesn't anyone realise that she is just as beautiful still as the other Barbies, despite her unusual hair and make-up and non-perfection, or why doesn't anyone realise that she basically saves Barbieland, and it doesn't matter in the slightest what she looks like, she's a hero? Thanks for making all girls who are unusual-looking or not stereotypically beautiful and perfect feel like freaks.Especially because of 'Weird' Barbie and Allan, the movie's 'diversity' just feels so forced.The board of Mattel (all real world men who are painfully stupid):With Will Farrell as CEO. First of all, what was funny 20 years ago is not really funny any more. Will Farrell should only be in this if there is some clear development of the narrative behind his behaviour. But there isn't. It's all a bit of a mess. We get a kick out of the mockery of foolish men at the beginning, but they are still in power regardless of anything. They are trying to put Barbie back in a box but she escapes (another missed opportunity - what would have happened if she goes in the box?), then they chase her into Barbieland for no reason (they wanted her to go back, she goes back, so why don't they just celebrate and stay where they are?), and then there's literally no point of them being there. Was casting Will Farrell just an attempt to get middle aged toxic men into the cinema?The cellulite issue:Barbie agrees to go to the real world so that she doesn't get cellulite. Literally. I do understand sarcasm and I get that this would be quite funny IF we as a society were beyond that already and IF there weren't any teenage girls watching but the film is a 12 and the beauty industry is making more money out of women's insecurities now than ever. If we're going to use sarcasm here, this needs to be addressed later, for example Barbie realising that it's our uniqueness that makes us beautiful (they really missed an opportunity using 'Weird' Barbie to drive that message) and cellulite doesn't matter, but no such thing - the movie concludes with the message that cellulite is indeed a malfunction. This has got to have been written by men.Apparently the only man involved in the screenplay was Noah Baumbach. Ah, co-produced by Mattel. Of course. All the male Mattel executives must have had a say. Now it makes sense. The movie is fun to watch and it's certainly witty, especially in the first half, and I really liked the performances and visuals. There seems to have been strong intention of depth and the movie is very political but ultimately fails to convey the right message and all it ends up being is a clever brand extension to make more money for Mattel.\", \"I have never seen a Barbie movie. My wife loves them and so I have heard some of the songs, but I have never actually watched one. Having seen some videos and commercials and things, I had a vague sense of what it was about.My wife and I went to go see this movie together, I was there more to support her than out of interest. I expected some silly, fun movie, something like the Lego Movie. I was wrong.The movie initially piqued my interest with its interesting depiction of cartoon behavior in live action. If you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. Interesting, for sure, but not groundbreaking. It slowly progressed and eventually had my full attention. It was something of a spiritual experience for me. The perfect humor drew me in, and the pure emotion portrayed at the end of the movie left me very touched and contemplative. It is an original masterpiece of a movie, sure to make you feel something.To sum it up: I came into the theater with low expectations, and I came out moved and impacted in a way that I have rarely felt.\", \"This movie is amazing. It perfectly describes womanhood in a way few movies that I've seen has. It shows how different women and men are treated and also the feeling of growing up as a woman. I started to miss all my childhood Barbies that we gave to my little cousin now. It's also completely hilarious and the cast is absolutely perfect. Almost No one else could play Barbie and Ken as good as Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling has. Even though it's technically about Barbie's DOSENT MEAN that it's aimed for children. It's perfect for women of all ages, and for men to learn more about what it's like to simply grow up and simply exist as a woman.\", 'Everything about this movie was incredible. The casting was on point, the sets are eye catching, the soundtrack is delectable! I can not express how much this movie has impacted my life. After seeing it not once, not twice, but three times it gets better and better every time. This movie is so hilarious while also being profound and thought-provoking. I left the theater crying all 3 times, each time shedding more tears than the last. Watching it with my mother was truly a special experience as I got to see how the themes of the movies impacted her as well. I think about this quote at least once a day,\" Mothers stand still so their daughters can look back and see how far they\\'ve come.\" I would recommend the Barbie Movie to anyone and everyone!', \"Super boring movie. It has a poor plot and everything is a cliche. The Barbie movie I watched recently left a lot to be desired. The plot felt cliché and predictable, lacking any real depth or originality. The characters were one-dimensional and failed to engage my interest. Additionally, the story quality was subpar, making it difficult to fully immerse myself in the world they were trying to create. Overall, I was disappointed with the lackluster storytelling and uninspiring execution of the movie.Why is there so much hype about this movie. Please don't watch this movie, please. It's pathetic!!\", 'First 10mins was annoying, then it came around as it showed us it was self-aware enough to realise. Over and hour in i was enjoying it. The comedy is on point all round. Then came the part when the women plot to lie and \"cheat\" on their boyfriends at the beach...\\nThat was a bit evil?. Im sure a lot of kids went to see this film and teens. The cinema i was in was sure packed but that wasnt a good message. \"To save barbieland we must lie and cheat on our boyfriends\" not sure a lot of parents would like that message either. Then the film wraps up wonderfully about barbie becoming human and herself instead of playing the role of barbie which was wonderful.. But are we supposed to just pretend and forget the message of this film just five minutes ago is to cheat on your boyrfriends and lie to them once youve gained their trust and made them happy? Hmm. Ryan gosling however was amazing to witness. Totally amazing just like he was in any other gosling film. Drive and blade runner being my favs.I will rewatch this because the comedy is very much on point but ill fast forward a lot of the extremist feminist speeches as they leave a questionable aftertaste when examined. I cannot give this film a 10 even though you can tell the production budget is amazing as were the acting. Go and see it if you have the itch. But it\\'s not for everyone.', 'This movie is not for kids despite the trailers I saw not showing it may not be for kids. I only saw 1 or two trailers for this movie, and it just looked like a fun movie about barbie in Barbieland and she for some reason goes into the real world. The sub plot of needing to help the girl that is playing with here is just that sub plot the main plot ends up being patriarchy and matriarchy. The sub plot should have been the main plot. The set design was great, the world looked beautiful, the story just sucked. Not all men are pigs or stupid in the real world and I thought they leaned way to hard into this. If they were going to go with this main plot of who is the top dog it should have ended with mainly barbies and 1 ken on council at the very least. I grew up playing with Barbies and I am sorry, but my Barbies always loved their kens. For Barbie to basically hate her ken was just a slap in the face in my opinion. There was not enough Barbieland and too much stupidity.', \"The most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. The jokes are meta and hilarious. The performances all through spectacular. This was like a fever dream and I can't wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again. I did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears. A movie everyone should go and watch. And how beautiful that Billie Eilish song was! We will definitely hear it live next year at the Academy Awards, where I hope Greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this (already) iconic film. Production design, script, directing, acting (especially Ryan bodied that role) and Best original song I would want to see awarded.\", 'I was looking forward to watch this movie and now I am severely disappointed. The first ten minutes was the best part, and I took me to the days where I had my dolls.Even as I am writing this review , I wonder why this movie was so underwhelming.I wish the story was better told, as soon as I left the Theater the movie was forgotten.And I think they will go for part 2 😒.Anyways, you must see it to make up your mind , there was a few nicely done comic relief moments that were great. Anyways , Ken is a big character in this movie , I felt much more liking for his character and his reasons were understandable.Go watch it and have your childhood moments revived .', \"I LOVED THE BARBIE MOVIE. It was very empowering and encouraging to young girls then ending is unexpected and kind of sad but the movie did not disappoint I was worried it wasn't gonna live up to the expectations but it exceed the expectations I want to watch it again and again I also love the marketing for this movie it deserves a higher rating. I hope there's a part 2 going into more detail so we get even more context about the choices and decisions or a continuation of the ending I also loved how they put the original barbie creator and inspiration for barbie that was a nice touch But it needed nicki minaj.\", 'The bright colours will appeal to youngsters, and thankfully the mindless feminism will sail over their heads, the feminism sticks with young adults but the nostalgia wont appeal, and for oldies the nostalgia is fun but the poor script and acting is appalling. I think Mattel have highlighted in a 2 hour film why their toy is now completely obsolete no matter how hard they try to rebrand it. If you like comedy watch the trailer, its not just a highlights reel, it is the enitrely of anything amsuing in the whole film. The cast made the best of a bad script, but the writers have missed an opportunity to make a classic comedy for the ages.', \"Interesting look at barbies world but maybe not enough pink 😂. Loved the musical numbers and the star studded cast who did not falter on their delivery. The unfortunate truth of the real world's Patriarchal society is laid out perfectly. Sound track was awesome especially Lizzo. Have to say fun to see all the pink outfits rolling into the cinemas not many icons can have this effect. Sex and the city excluded. Doesn't take itself too seriously and deffinetly falls into the comedy genre comfortably. Will Ferrell is a great addition although I word have liked to have seen more of him. In the end it is Barbie's world.\", \"I adored Ryan Gosling as Ken, and Margot Robbie was perfect as Barbie. (Parents, this is not a movie for little kids.) The beginning was hopeful and I loved the cast and the amazing set of Barbie Land. Barbie's playhouse was amazing! But as it went on, it became way too political and preachy and went downhill. If I did this movie, I would have made it a love story between Ken and Barbie and had them get married, making use of all the cool Barbie toys and her friends. But of course that would have been strangely politically incorrect, even though that's what most people still do these days. So it was a way cool set, amazing cast, but way too political for my taste.\", 'The surface-level: Barbie is vibrant, fun, and immensely enjoyable. Robbie and Gosling are stellar, and Gerwig\\'s camera has never been in better focus.What I really want to talk about is the idea of perfection and that flaws are not deterrents; flaws are what make us who we are.Barbie is perfect. But what is perfection? Beauty? Endless dance parties? A world where everyone gets along? A world without worry? No; those are hollow. Perfection is an illusion. There is no happiness or self-worth in perfection. Perfection is a lie that hides the real joy of life.Owning who you are, finding joy with yourself, being brave enough to face the conflicts each rising sun brings, and combating the fear that you aren\\'t good enough is where real, true experiences are found.Barbie is perfect, and she wants to maintain her perfection. But as her journey unfolds, she discovers something better-self-realization.Ken lacks agency, and Barbie cannot give that to Ken. He must find it himself. Barbie is about empowerment, discovery, and owning the person you are. No one defines you; you define you.Barbie and Ken\\'s first experience in the real world is an all-too-expected scene. Unfortunately, the likely reaction to it from some will also be expected.Barbie is an object, something to obtain. Ken is a person, someone to converse with or admire. The difference in experience is drastic, and-sadly-one that will surely be looked over and taken at face value.The point of the scene is not \"it\\'s hard to be a woman.\" The point is that Ken is oblivious to the difference. He\\'s so wrapped up in his own experience that he can\\'t see Barbie\\'s. He doesn\\'t question why their experiences are different; he doesn\\'t care. He just wants his experience to be enjoyable. He wants his life to be more, even at the expense of others.Too many will see it as surface level. And too many will refuse to dig deeper. Instead, they\\'ll be content to be outraged or faux-offended. \"My life is hard too!\" they\\'ll say. And that\\'s the point. Her life is hard, his life is hard, everyone\\'s life is hard. Consideration is all it takes to better both.Barbie has a lot to say about agency and self-realization, and really, the film is quite meta in the best way.', \"As one of the most anticipated films of the year, Barbie has managed to meet all audience expectations -especially cinephiles - and make it the most daring film of the year. Director Greta Gerwig (supported by screenwriter Noah Baumbach) doesn't just deliver a successful portrayal of all aspects of this popular icon: colorful set designs, stunning costumes and make-up, great music (they all sing!), the history of the Barbie doll, but also social commentary and philosophical analysis on existentialism, patriarchy, feminism, diversity, inclusion and all that packaged in sarcasm in the modern sense. As a film, Barbie delivers it all: fun, excitement and seriousness. The casting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken is also the right choice. Barbie reminds us again that summer box office hits can be really fun and good.\", \"So good, the emotions, the reality and how it came together as a live action BARBIE film was perfect and outstanding which is good for adults as well as children. I am so impressed how well this was pulled off and the details from the outfits to the design of the sets was outstanding. There was laughing and crying in this film and which relates to everyday life and having all the different barbies was brilliant! My favourite has to be the weird BARBIE because I definitely relate to her more! I recommend watching this and giving it a go because you may think oh it's just a kids film but once you've watched it, it's not what you expect and I'm itchy to watch it again!\", 'This is just one of the two films that are released on the same day (the other being Oppenheimer). Firstly, the movie itself was good; a few comic jokes here and there along with a few heartfelt moments at the end. But I\\'m not technically a Barbie fan; I just see something that I fancy on the big screen and watch it!Anyway, after watching the movie, I thought to myself, \"Gosh, I\\'m amazed at how the filmmakers got to create such a variety of cast members, as well as make such a great movie for the girls to enjoy.\"For someone as me - who is somewhat of a film expert and a cinema employee - to see what might be just the most iconic blockbuster movie of the year so far, I have to say that it could (by a margin) be busy for the first couple of weeks of the summer holidays!Overall, though it was good, it\\'s not my favourite movie as I\\'m not a fan of the doll franchise.', \"It's a good movie. Walking out of it I knew people wouldn't like it considering we rarely have a women's actual point of view in cinema. It's actually quite funny seeing people's reactions to it as if everything that we were showed in the 2 hours of the movie isn't true.In my viewing people were clapping, laughing and crying. It's touching and I'm sure many will relate wether people want to admit to it or not. (This movie isn't about a perfect doll)That being said if you don't like musicals you might not love this movie there are quite a few numbers in this film. Not bad ones just some are abit longer than I'd like.Overall I'd watch again and I've never actually owned a Barbie 👍🏼\", 'Massive fan of Margot Robbie but she is so much better than this.....From the get go, this film has no context and just looks like it was rushed together. It certainly has some funny parts but there are few and far between. The film centres to much around a fake world and not enough in the \"real world\". There is also to many rude references which to be honest, weren\\'t necessary. I get it a 12A but surely they knew many of us would be bringing kids along.It was not a fun ride and will be one film that I will be forgetting about quite quickly. Potential was there but the storyline wasn\\'t. Disappointed!', 'Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions.', 'Fantastic musicals, a brutally honest storyline on challenges and struggles for both genders across the barbie land and our world.A must watch of the year 2023.Barbie: A Journey of ImaginationIn the vibrant world of Toyland, a place where toys come to life, Barbie, a beautiful and kind-hearted doll, finds herself on a captivating adventure of self-discovery and empowerment.

With her dark magic, she manipulates innocent toys into causing havoc and despair across Toyland.As Barbie and her newfound friends journey through enchanted forests and whimsical lands, they encounter numerous challenges and confront their fears. Each trial brings them closer together and strengthens their resolve to defeat Malina and restore the world\\'s imagination.Along the way, Barbie discovers the power of belief in oneself. Initially uncertain of her abilities, she realizes that her kind heart and compassionate nature make her a unique and formidable force. This self-discovery becomes a source of inspiration for Ruffle and Sparkle, who learn to embrace their individual strengths.As the trio approaches the final showdown with Malina, they face their most significant obstacle yet: the power of doubt.

It inspires both children and adults to let their imaginations soar and to find the magic that exists within each and every one of us.', 'This movie was such great experience to live. It\\'s a fun, entertaining, deep, and amazing piece of art. It was very funny at times, made me cry other times, and made me feel nostalgic and warm and proud and all of these different feelings. But most importantly it made me think! I really love it when movies discuss topics that matter and shake your ideas a little bit. I loved the cast, the costume designs, the music and everything in between. Margot Robbie is a queen, her acting was amazing and she\\'s just the perfect cast for this role. Also, Ryan did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Judging by the propaganda that surrounded it and the hype around it I didn\\'t have high expectations but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. Also, I have to say that the story of this movie is very very similar to \"Free guy\" the one with Ryan Reynolds but it was done well so I can\\'t complain.', \"First of all , the marketing of this movie was truly another level of promoting movies, while getting banned in some countries , mine decided to put it under age restriction.So i went with the hype arround it, all pinky and sparkling to dive in barbie world as an old player i was expecting that the movie will touch a place in my but sadly it was flat and boring , not only that i still can't see a picture to be told behind it.The actress felt flat too even the outfits they used to promote the movie were way better then the ones they used in the movie .4\\nbut i enjoyed ryan gossling acting and at some point he was funny.\", 'I thought the plot was very out of control and did not have a way to end itself. Most scenes last 1-2 minutes too long and the ending is terrible. No resolve was ever made to the story which leaves. We have this whole movie about how both matriarchy and patriarchy are not perfect or good, but instead of leaning into that the movie ends with everything going back to how they were before. Politics aside, this movie had no clear goal in mind for the plot and it showed in a very convoluted mess. One positive is the set design and costumes were amazing. The actors were okay in this movies and flashes of comedy was shown, but most jokes are over used or just fall flat.', \"Expertly written, perfectly plastic visually, with a strong thematic mix of The Matrix and The Wizard of Oz. BUT! It very much made me think of late career comedy specials from George Carlin; not as fun as expected, but there are zero flaws in the logic of the message.So many little nuances that pull you into the well crafted universe bit by bit. The added touch of there being multiple Barbies and Ken's that are not differentiated by name was genius. It may make it somewhat difficult to discuss the slight differences between the characters, but so what?I just hope they don't make a sequel. I can't imagine how they could do that without it being a cheap cash grab, and that would be a shame for a movie with this kind of intellect.\", 'The movie did some real weird worldbuilding where none of the rules were consistent. I had to keep reminding myself that barbieland was made by men, therefore barbieland is not an exact opposite of the real world - it\\'s a rendering of what \"men\" think female utopia is. But it wasn\\'t a direct opposite of real world either. I doubt many viewers will actually be able to internalize that as part of the lore.The parallel between realworld and barbieland just didn\\'t make sense therefore it felt like a plot fail. If barbies are all important unlike women in the real world, where does Ken swooning over Barbie land on on that real world spectrum?Im just going to say, the fact that Barbie has 0 complex feelings until the lady from the real world played with her, but Ken was aware of being unhappy WHILE being not a person but an accessory to Barbie is the kind of double crossing i didn\\'t expect. I was confused about which point it tried proving.Ryan Gosling has a real chance to become an icon for incels after this performance. He gets rejected, creates an ultramasculine society, and at the end Barbie apologises to him and he rebrands? He was a villain and did not get a redemption arc. He shouldn\\'t even be sentient in this universe as much as he is. I expected Barbie to be honest with him and say she just doesn\\'t love him, or that she wasn\\'t made to have those feelings to him because Matell did not give her those feelings. Instead she apologises for not giving him more attention?Anyways, it wasn\\'t feminist enough for me. It felt like it avoided some major issues of real life (like the phrase \"we just learned how to hide it better\" that did not get addressed whatsoever). Like, the Barbies now know that women don\\'t have it as great as them in the real world? How does that solve anything?Maybe i am just reading too deep into a movie with flawed worldbuilding, made for people who don\\'t generally see the gender bias around them?4 for some funny jokes, but it could be funnier.', \"Very light spoilers.I didn't go into this movie thinking I would love it as much as I did. I went because I have 9 and 6 year old girls and especially the youngest loves Barbie. There were definitely jokes that were not appropriate for them but went right over their head, but they very much enjoyed the movie.The message was great and Ryan Gosling stole the show as a dopey Ken. Margot was great as Barbie, as were all of the actresses who played Barbies. I especially loved America Ferrera in her role! She was great.There were many times I cried in this movie because it's so on the nose about being a woman today, and it hit me hard having two young girls. I did not expect to shed any tears so that was a surprise!The reason I gave this an 8 instead of a 10 is because there were definitely some plot holes, like why Barbie had to bring America and her daughter to Barbie Land and what the very bad thing that would happen was (per the execs) by Barbie leaving the Barbie world. Many things weren't explained or didn't make much sense, but it was still a joy to watch.Overall I loved the movie and I'm so glad we went. All women should see this movie.\", \"At first, I didn't want to go on this film. Then I was drowned to the movie theater by the advertising campaign expecting something. But nothing is actually occurred.I mean really it was as simple as it gets entertainment, not even interesting, sometimes worst to say boring.Thus, I honestly don't understand the universal admiration for this movie. It literally has nothing to offer.I went to the bathroom and I didn't feel like I was losing anything because I had a deep inner feeling that I really had nothing to lose in this film. Furthermore, I think that is the best categorization for this movie.You have nothing to lose if you don't see it.\", \"I think the significance of Barbie wasn't the fact that it was a fun, joyous, all around well movie. I felt everything. From the point being that women to this day hold such little power. You can't want to be skinny you need to want to be healthy. You need to show off but not too much. Nothing you'll ever do will be perfect to anyone in power. But along with this it brings up the fact that emotions are something everyone can experience and that it's okay, you can be emotional and logical at the same time. It's okay to not know if what you're doing is right. I won't ever know if I was made to do what I want to do. Am I supposed to be an astronaut? Is that what my purpose is? I feel lazy when I see that everyone is out having amazing times and I'm stuck in the same continuous loop. Literally, everything that can make me me isn't actually me at all and the thought scares me. In our world, we want and fight for power yet nothing ever comes of it. And this movie is the most beautiful way to showcase all of the world and what women truly do go through.\", \"Truthfully, after seeing this film once, I did not realize just how many gems there are in it. Everything in the movie is representative of something else. It is more than just literal. For eg. Barbie was not into Ken as we are accustomed to because her owner did not have a Ken doll. The adding on of the character Ruth gave so much life to this movie. This one was definitely dedicated to women. As a girl, if you haven't seen it, I would recommend you go as soon as you can. It is especially empowering to young girls because it truly shows the essence of a woman. The trailer was not enough to capture the beauty of this movie. It was definitely more than what I expected. I completely understand why anyone would think that the men were portrayed as 'dumb' (obviously in the real world, men aren't as bad as the movie makes it seem) but I think what was meant to come from this movie was a deeper message, and this may have been necessary to really capture what the movie was trying to portray for all women. It was needed to emphasize the movie so to speak.\", \"I have to express my disappointment with this movie, as it is riddled with an overwhelming number of loopholes and plot holes that hinder the overall viewing experience. It's quite disheartening to find that there is a noticeable absence of a compelling and engaging story, leaving the audience wanting more substance and coherence.Frankly, I cannot help but think that investing time in watching this film is not the best use of one's entertainment hours. Instead, I would suggest diverting attention to purchasing a Barbie doll, allowing for a more enjoyable and imaginative playtime experience.In conclusion, I find it regrettable that this movie fails to live up to expectations, and I consider it to be an utter waste of valuable time and cinematic potential.\", \"This movie was a great way to redefine what Barbie stands for teenagers, and adults - as well. It was a great way to open up a thoughtful conversation with kids, and adults about common world problems.Nowadays, Barbie is held at a standard of just being pink, and girly, and frilly. But this movie did such a great job redefining it, showing how the barbie universe was so relatable in the most unlike of ways was mind-blowing.Aside from the movie addressing things like feminism, patriarchy, matriarchy, self-esteem, etc. Barbie brings up an array of positive character development traits throughout; one of the main, was how in the beginning of the movie - she was settled with her life and didn't want anything to change. And during the middle, didn't want to take any accountability or initiative when the Ken's took over. But, as the movie progressed, it didn't a great job of showing Barbie taking action, solving problems, AND making life changing decisions.There is so much good to address in the movie. For the people who didn't get the point of it, they HAVE to rewatch it with an open mind. Because there is so much to unpack in it; the cast, the music, the script.\", \"I think Barbie is one of the most powerful movies to impact the world! Portraying men as the women in todays society and American culture is brilliant to me. It's movies like this that will teach the young how unfair the world is and that's okay! The sooner we can help bring equality to the country, like it was made for, the sooner we can learn to help each other. I will say it's a shame Greta wasn't able to do things her way because I feel like it was very apparent how much the story changed midway, but either way It was a sweet message to every girl and their mothers, an acknowledgement to the struggles women face that men have little to no idea about. I really loved this movie and all the little allegories they used.\", \"I was hesitant when I put it on but WOW! I never imagined it'd be as good as it is! The acting was on point, beautiful sets, and an amazing storyline & plot! 👏 when I first attempted to watch it, I thought it wouldn't be worth much so I was doing other things, caught myself several times stopping to watch until I finally paused it, finished what I was doing and sat down to watch it from the beginning and I'm so glad I did. I've already recommended it to my friends. Glad I was able to take advantage of Amazon having it to purchase as I hate movie theaters. So it worked out well being as I can now watch it whenever I like. Which I'm sure will be often.\", 'Barbie is a very good start movie-try to popularize the feminism idea to normal people. Many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea. After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw \"Let me show you\" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up.', \"Right of the bat I should say that I only got interested in this movie because it featured Ryan Gosling - and honestly, if it wasn't for him, the movie wouldn't even get one star from me.The movie theater was filled with little girls, while I think this isn't really something a kid should be watching.It wasn't inspiring at all for me, nor did it make me emotional. The point wasn't really well made, in fact it mostly ended up being corny and worn-out. I really found it hard to sit through the whole movie, especially the ending scenes, I just wanted it to finally be over. Wasn't really worth all the hype and the money spent.\", 'So, the Barbie movie was \"meh\"There\\'s been a ton of hype about the film\\'s political bent and honestly, yes... the patriarchal nonsense is a bit heavy handed but that\\'s not even what made it so bad.It was just dumb.It was too long and nonsensical and I really don\\'t know how to sum it up other than that.I laughed a couple of times and one or two parts almost resonated with me, but then it just went from relatable to preachy and I just eyerolled so hard.It was mostly just boring and dumb, and that\\'s disappointing because it looked great, the cast was great, and it had such potential to be a great self-aware meta comedy. It just failed so hard at doing that.My summary: Barbie gains sentience, fights the patriarchy, becomes a real girl, and goes to the gynecologist.This movie will NOT appeal to young kids.I can almost guarantee they\\'ll find it boring.It\\'s not a typical kids movie riddled with double entendres and over-their-heads adult humor. It\\'s just adult humor and it\\'s not even particularly funny (just my opinion).It absolutely looks amazing, it looks like it was made with kids in mind, it looks like a nostalgia trip for moms, and it looks like family fun.However... with the exception of looking amazing, it accomplishes none of that. (The Mario Movie did all of those things sooo much better in my opinion. THAT movie was darn near perfect.)If you wanna see Barbie, go for it. But if you\\'re considering taking little kids I would not personally recommend it. 😘', 'In this movie you can see deep meaning sense of live, you need to know just little things before or to be open mind and the whole univers will show appear for you. Most of scenes have a hidden or deep mening, i am not going to write too much about movie because i am here to sustain Greta Gerwing and i am very grateful for her because she had the creep to made it. Maybe more director will do movies for our souls not just for action,adventure,etc...For me it was the greatest movie who I saw it ever. Any people should see through rows and see the true meaning of the movie. All my best to the Greta Gerwig <3.', \"I liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it. I did think the feminism was a little too 'on the nose' sometimes. But it's difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences. Overall it was a job well done. The set was beautiful and everything expected from a Barbie movie. Simu Liu and Ryan Gosling were showstealers as rivalling Kens and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast. I was also really surprised that the slogan 'a movie for people who love Barbie and people who hate Barbie' caught the essence. They didn't shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the Barbie dolls and Mattel as a company.\", \"Barbie movie is a comedy which is based on absurd plot twists and things which happen throughout the film. It offers many laughs and has a lot of hidden jokes which add up to a great movie. I was worried there would be much too many musical scenes, but after watching it I believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places. The whole scene nearing the end of the film (I won't spoil anyhting, don't worry) was just so well done, I loved that the play on women-male dynamics was very lighthearted, but just serious enough. There is apsolutely no men-bashing.The Ken's were put in the women's places from the Real World and men in the theatres watching saying that the movie is 'too feminist' and is 'men-bashing' are failing to see their hypocrisy.\", 'Yes Barbie is the title of the movie but when watching it I increasingly feel like she is only playing the supporting role to Ken in a weird way.Ken is kinda a simp but he\\'s also the only one that has a proper story around him, starting as a nobody, then his whole personality changed when he got his \"redpilled\" moment, got some musical songs to perform, have a comradery moment with the other Ken\\'s before it finally went back to normal. It all made him a lot more human than Barbie ever was in the film.The weirdest thing in this movie though, is that despite singing girl power and feminism, it doesn\\'t have likeable female characters outside of their good looks. Most of the females in this film are bland, mean, manipulative, and somewhat narcissitic especially when the word perfect always getting brought up. They don\\'t even put in any scenes about the hardship of women, outside of maybe the booty grabbing part which is done like a joke. I wished they would\\'ve shown more of that instead of putting that in a speech. And you get a female lead that doesn\\'t even want change or do anything with it unless being pushed around. There is no process around any of the achievements or struggles on the women\\'s side, just results in a form of speeches and short scenes.', \"For a movie about a line of plastic dolls, it managed to be the most deeply human movie to come out in a while. I've don't think that I've walked out of theater at the end of a movie with the feeling of so much solidarity with the folks around me and I'm already trying to make a plan for seeing it again in theaters.From the huge amount of artists work that went into making intricate sets that had the feeling of big Broadway ensemble stage pieces to the soundtrack, I can't say enough good things about this movie. Go see it, take your teenagers or your mom, but Greta Gerwig went and made something really special.\", \"I don't understand all the hype around this movie. I found it boring, with almost no plot. It had a few fun moments, nothing too funny, I don't think I ever laughed throughout the whole movie. A great performance from Ryan Gosling indeed, although Margot Robbie was perhaps mediocre. He definitely stole the thunder. Regarding patriarchy and feminism, it merely scratched the surface of those terms. It was perhaps more of a simulation of how an elementary teacher would explain patriarchy to kids. It doesn't offer anything to adults, except for if they lived in a cave and never heard about patriarchy.\", \"The plot is interesting enough to make you feel interested and intrigued even if you're not a barbie fan or just not a fan of cliches, it has a beautiful meaning behind it and it's the best movie for you to watch if you're a woman . This movie is great , i usually don't watch movies with high hopes but i did with this one and still it surprised me . The marketing crew did an insanely perfect job , the hole mall was wearing pink and it helped people on building the hype for the movie. The whole thing is genius, the performances ( specially ryan and margot ) are outstanding and genuinely really good , the direction is great and the whole soundtrack is fantastic. Final consideration : GO WATCH BARBIE , it's worth it.\", 'Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more on the second watch. Definitely not the all-enlightening and god-saving movie to the feminist movement but it does touch on a lot of issues in such a beautiful, greta gerwig-esque way.The Barbie-Gloria, Gloria-Sasha, and Barbie-Ruth interactions are so impactful for mothers and daughters. Teared up a few times and would have definitely full on cried if I was home alone while watching the movie.Ryan Gosling was so good at playing Ken and making the audience laugh at him, laugh with him, feel bad for him, get mad at him, and understand him.Margot Robbie is just overall the perfect Barbie.', 'Film story line is GREAT! You can totally understand what does director and writer they create a UNBELIVABLE FILM...If You Like BARBIE you must watch! But if you hate BARBIE you must barely GO TO WATCH THIS!!!Im never expect how can casting can be so professional to let Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling being Barbie & Ken, Im barely enjoy their acting fun and enjoy their characther in this film... Like the Acting coach said\"Make believe.\"Moral of the stories, In The Critical World we are living in a terrible world, we always hope we had an wonderful life, But if we really live in a freedom and peaceful world, we may be not having a perfect life in ourself, GO ENJOY YOUR LIFE LIKE A BARBIE!!!', 'Why destroyed? Cause there was nothing to defend that lovely doll. If you ever watched Toy Story and if you understood what Woody felt after being discarded... It is all in the Barbie movie. Second issue is about the Creator (ghost of Ruth Handler). Barbie meets her in the kitchen I felt like she Barb is a Neo from Matrix...too many similarities. Finally the Geppetto (Ruth) will grand Barbie\\'s wish. No and no! Barbie in the movie is a narcisst who ruled cause she was aromantic. She is like a child in an adult body. Sugar daddys are looking for that kind of persons. Matriarchy without a c..t not a hard job apparently. They show how to use men for women advantages only. Finally thx to \"Geppetto\" she the Barbie got a c..t for herself so she moved out from Barbieland. It is really all wrong. Barbie is not supposed to be Paris Hilton biography. Barbie is a doll and not deserve a movie. Barbie is a mannequin and a business. You can not make a good movie about a Barbie when you use a Pinocchio idea. Barbie aspired to be a real woman. I saw it already in Pinocchio. Except he wanted to be a real boy.', 'I was really looking forward to watching this movie. Great cast, great global hype, and the feeling that it wants to go further than just a \"girly\" Barbie movie.As a matter of fact, I was quite disappointed. While the message that is carried in this film is really important, I think that it was just to easy. It only talked about things we already knew, and not in a subtile or in a new way. I think it could have been so much more interesting and impactful. The scenario is also easy, you already know how it is going to end in the first 15 minutes. No surprises.Nevertheless, I must mention the great cast, costumes, sets and music. But in the end, it\\'s just a colorful feel-good movie, that is empty inside. Mid. 5/10.', 'As most are saying the casting was great. The costumes were awesome. Barbie land set design was on point. The story could have been so much better. It started out fine but dragged in the middle. It became preachy. We know, we live it everyday. Mention patriarchy and move on. I thought it would have been nice to show both sides working together equally in the end. It might not have been realistic but we would have left the theater with a smile. I was not alone leaving the theater thinking what was that all about. I did not see too many children in the theater which was good because it would have been way over their head.', 'Didn\\'t know what to expect... was pleasantly surprised. Clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the US. Liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society. Was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle, sticking together, through intelligence, compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure. It encouraged acceptance of people with differences, people that don\\'t look like you and challenged the battles over \"what\\'s feminine\" or \"what\\'s masculine\" (after all Barbie and Ken have no genitals).', \"I've never EVER wrote here on a movie. But now I just had to. Im 31 years old. Grew up with Barbie. So I guess im in the target group.Visuals? 10/10.But storyline and depth? 2-3. The feminism is strong throughout the movie but for me personally it gets mean. And the script is also changing too many times. I was happy in the beginning but then they changed what I thought the movie was about .The movie was too long, the girls were mean and superficial, and when I thought Barbie have learned how to treat a man, she just strikes back with selfishness. Too long monologues, bad songs. Disappointed.\", \"This movie is absolutely genius. There are so many reasons why our society needed this movie and all\\nof it's real life messages. The emotion. The monologues. The acting. The music. Everything was perfect!Barbie addresses the real world in hopes of finding the girl who played with her but ends up embarking on more of a self discovery journey. The real world isn't what she thought it would be, and Barbie world has been taken over by the Kens. With teamwork and unlikely friendship, the Barbies are able to take back Barbieland. The feminism throughout this movie ROCKED. I loved how it didn't necessarily bash men, but it did shine a light on the the massive egotism that tends to overcome men and their logic. As well as their belief to be superior to women. The was the best movie of the entire year. And one do the best movies of the entire decade so far.On behalf all women everywhere, we thank you!!\", \"Me and my wifey watched it at VIP cinema seats, 0 expectations - sadly both got dissapointed - movie way too over hyped, 0 depth, it's alright for children , daughters I guess, but we wouldn't be surprised if most of the adults and teenagers would be dissapointed in this movie plot especially.We genuinely believe if the second movie comes out about titled - barbie and Ken in the real world the plot and hopefully the writing would be much more interesting, fun, funny, deeper 🤔\\nOne last thing every problem pointed out in the movie was touched so lightly at times felt like it's Cinderella ish..\", \"Although I had read varing opinions on the film, I hadn't bought into them too much as I didn't want anything to be spoiled. It isn't the standard kind of film i would watch but I found it fun, colourful and heart felt with a sad, honest but important undertone and message. I dont see how embracing Inclusivity, equality, femininity and respecting bodily and mental autonomy is a negative. I think this film will make certain people uncomfortable and easily confused as to the message it is trying to convey but I'm glad they didn't dumb it down for those particular audiences and were brave enough not to pander. My kids loved the film and it allowed for some discussion and reflection without breaking the fun vibe.\", \"Thank you for this movie ! It's beautiful by the décor, costumes and music, but so much more beautiful with the message. We do need that kind of movie in our world.People (men, lol) seems to be confused after seeing the Barbie movie. Maybe it's time to accept the world as it is now and understand how cruel it could be for the half of the world population. I think you are proving the point of the movie.We do need more movies like Barbie, that can keep the funny in important messages. In many movies, they need violence, rudeness and/or vulgarity to show how the female character is in pain. Thanks to Barbie, we don't have to see this to know, we don't have to be triggered to understand what kind of feelings she is going through. Barbie is like us. Barbie is for us. Thank you, Barbie !\", \"I did have a very high expectation for this movie but.. Sorry it was the worst movie I've ever watched. I tried to find the message from this movie but I couldn't. It seems like it tried to send a message move our hearts but it wasn't delivered to audiences. Because I have no idea what exactly they wanted to make. So what did they really want to make? Musical film? Comedy? Touching stories? Girls can do anything? Or just colorful cute movies? They mixed it all and added it all so the movie became just lame and cloudy..\\nI hoped the movie just could be more kitschy, tacky, easy, unrealistically happy and funny like 90s, 2000s movies.I just felt sorry for Ryan Gosling and other actors and actresses.\", \"As someone who has been a fan of Barbie since I was a little girl, this movie was an incredible journey. The set was beautiful, the cast was great, and the soundtrack amazing. My favourite part though was its commentary on feminism and how the patriarchy effects both women and men negatively. It was achieved in a light hearted and caring way. The original hopes and dreams of Barbie's existence are brought to life, as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish. In a world which does not always cater to women's needs, this film does a great job of holding us all accountable. We now live in a post-Barbie movie era, and I'm so excited to see what the future holds.\", 'The movie starts off well with a surprisingly clever and colorful depiction of Barbie\\'s world. She drinks out of empty cups, showers under a waterless shower, can fly around as if transported by a hand just a like a real doll house. At some point, Barbie starts becoming a real woman by thinking about death, having cellulite and her feet flatten out. She goes into the real world to find the girl that broke the spacetime continuum and started to make her real.All this time, we see lots of Barbies (all of them named Barbie) that have advanced degrees, are racially diverse, with different body types even. The Kens are brainless bodybuilders who don\\'t have any occupation other than being pretty and overly infatuated with the Barbies. Ryan Gosling does an excellent job and portrays Ken perfectly which was surprising to me. Definitely an Oscar performance for the actor. Also Margot Robbie is absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking across the whole movie, a true real life Barbie doll who also plays the part perfectly. We also have basically half the cast of Sex Education and lots of references to other movies like: the Matrix, Pinocchio and maybe others which i haven\\'t observed.This being said, the problems start to pile up now cause all of the above is just a superficial sugar coating for the real reason of the movie: gender theory propaganda. The world is reduced to the patriarchy. When Barbie and Ken go to the real world, Barbie feels objectified and powerless and Ken starts understanding the patriarchy. While the real world is a true patriarchy the Barbie world is a true matriarchy. Long story short, Ken goes back to the Barbie world, establishes the patriarchy there and then Barbie and \"her owner\" go back to the Barbie world and reestablish the matriarchy. The movie is blunt and frankly disappointing in its portrayal of men and women. Men are nothing. Women are everything. Men, portrayed through Ken, don\\'t have meaning, and are not supposed to have meaning in life, they just exist to be \"beach\"-ing and simp over Barbies. Women on the other hand are everything: lawyers, teachers, senators, presidents, PhDs, scientists etc.I dare the audience to think of the Barbie movie in reverse, women are nothing and men are everything. That would be an outrageous movies and the directors would be down right cancelled.The movie does not present the true condition of being a woman today, but it just hates on men and wants them crushed and powerless in a sort of historical revenge. It reduced the world and the complex social dynamics between men and women to patriarchy. The movie it\\'s divisive, destructive and does not solve any problems. I honestly felt like i was in an Orwell novel. It\\'s a pitty, because the set was very good and had a lot of potential for something deep and meaningful, something that could have brought men and women together as a team. But instead it resorted to SJW, woke, extreme left ideology and apparently the audience was brainlessly having it.', \"This is such a unique film! It was so much fun, and had its sweet moments as well! All the choreography was excellently done. The costumes were amazing! I also loved the take Greta had on barbie, and some real problems women and men face. I truly feel like this was such a special movie- and it does not feel like anything I have ever seen before. It was also very funny! (And that's coming from someone who does not like comedy's) I was giggling all the way through the movie. So sad that this gets so much hate, I just feel like it's such a fun movie that everyone should see. So much fun!! Greta Gerwig has done it again!\", 'The film not only talks about the role of women in society, but also about how men are affected by the behavior and criticism of this repressed society full of hatred and misunderstanding. Both genders in real life suffer discrimination and minimization in labor fields, parental roles, etc. And this is something the movie makes mention of, but one has to be a bit more picky and watch the movie several times to understand the real message of the movie. About the humor, it\\'s okay, but at times it can feel a bit fierce out of place, not to call it forced.About its music, the film has several pieces, but they\\'re not able to shine, as well as the movie itself, and just a few like \"What was I made for\", or \"Dance the night away\" are remembered out of all the film has to offer.', 'Have you watched Barbie?Yes I am talking about the SMASH movie that topped the global box office, broke records and made 1 BILLION dollars in just 17 days...We watched the movie recently and couldn\\'t help but think that the success was anything BUT coincidental...This is the most successful movie directed by a woman, EVERIt champions intersectional feminism showing a world where:1. Black women can be presidents\\n2. Trans women can be doctors\\n3. Disabled women can dance and join the party\\n4. Plus size women can be desired\\n5. Mature women can mentor, encourage and support younger women\\n6. Men can be allies and support women\\'s causesWhat I also loved is that the movie showed that:1. Men can find happiness when they decide to be themselves, rather who society expects them to be\\n2. You can still be a man and cry and love yourself and support others without having to fight and \"prove\" your masculinity\\n3. Women don\\'t need men to be happy and vice versa\\n4. There\\'s beauty in the mundane and everyday experiences, such as going to the doctorIt is obvious that the team behind this movie was incredibly diverse.You can see diversity of thought and willingness to include different people, and groups, in almost every scene!!! ... WOW !Diversity & Inclusion is not just the right, and ethical thing, for every company to do, it is also something that creates masterpieces and makes $$$$$$$ !Go Barbie !!!GO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION.', \"I struggle to comprehend the hype surrounding this movie. Apart from the political commentary and feminist themes it presents, I find it difficult to see the appeal. While the film boasts a cast of well-known actors and Margot Robbie's performance is commendable, the overall plot seems lacking in direction. Additionally, the quality of the special effects and CGI left much to be desired. The ending, in particular, struck me as one of the most nonsensical conclusions I've encountered. There is one positive aspect I can acknowledge - the movie successfully revitalized the brand and its color scheme for a female audience. This achievement can be attributed to the effective marketing strategy that propelled its success. If you would like, I can help you further develop and refine your thoughts on the movie.\", \"I really enjoyed this movie. Every Barbie that I grew up with gets featured (No, I did not own them all). I love the story and the fact that all ages can get something out of it, which made it feel even more relateable.The story does have it flaws, but are quite foregiveable I think.I know some people are complaining about the characteristics of Ken, but if you were into Barbie in the 80's, you would know that Ken has always been as he is displayed in the movie. He never was GI Joe, that is for sure.I love the fact of the deeper layer and message in the film. I will recommend it to anyone that is open to the pinkness :)\", \"I had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release, however for me that's as good as it got, brilliant marketing. The first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring, leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just weren't that touching. I can see what they were trying to do with #girlpower but I found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to 'put ken back in his place' which I get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if you're trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power. I would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real 'dream world' looks like. The Speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film. At least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through.\", \"Went to the Wednesday Barbie Blow Out showing - I went into it thinking it was going to be a cute charming movie. It wasn't anything I expected, I've never seen a movie like this before, on all levels from writing, the sets. Every actor has such amazing range. The way each scene transformed your mind set, having you want more. This movie was so good It was written with current, real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with Easter eggs, while giving ode to the past and so self aware. The writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles, heartache, dissonance into everyday life, while making you cry of both laughter and sadness.\", 'The opening scene parodying 21st Century a space oddacy was hilarious! I like it, clever. It\\'s an idea dropped into the world which changed the society fundamentally. Babies be gone, professional dolls here we come!I suppose it\\'s then interesting when Barbie does encounter the real world and finds it not to have changed. It does not represent the ideals they hold in the Barbie world which they thought had spread through the world creating a new reality. No, Barbie in the real world is just one idea in a sea of ideas.It\\'s then fascinating to see Ken enter the real world. He finds out that Barbie is not the only idea that exists. There are others. However, instead of using this new information to find and build his own identity, he quickly discoveres the patriarchy.Using the pariachy as a tool to surpress and subordinate women in the world which women had built for themselves. His whole life he has believed that all that matters is Barbie and Barbie\\'s world. He therefore returns to Barbieworld to use his new found power to dominate as a form of revenge. His obsession with Barbie has not dissappeard it has manifest in a new way. He is now taking revenge on himself in a way, as he acts out behaviours which serve him superficially, but don\\'t actually nourish his soul, his true person. He\\'s mimicking the Behavior or Barbie, trying to make her feel the way he felt. Toxic masculinity, and domination, it\\'s an identity born out of pain and obsession.His story ach is the most simple to understand, he learns from Barbie that he can love himself. He can form his own identity which doesn\\'t revolve around someone else. His identity can be one which is very personal to him and not one that exists to serve the needs of others or to impress others. He ends his obsession and idolization of Barbie and looks to love his friends, his Kens.Barbie existing in Barbieworld finds herself to be always happy, fully in love with herself and powerful in that love for herself she creates an entire world which functions beautifully, or so she believes.It\\'s almost like Barbieworld is the internal personal world of an imagined player of the Barbie game. It\\'s ordered and structured to produce good outputs. Mental stability. This sense of perfect is safe and change is not welcome. Why would Barbie ever want to change when Barbie is perfect.However, the real world, as Barbie later finds out, is messy and complex. We watch as the feelings, insecurities, and anziety of the Mother, Gloria, are spilled onto the page and into the world of Barbie.Barbie goes to \"weird Barbie\" who, she\\'s is told, can cure her.Weird Barbie is the way that she is because some child decided they didn\\'t want to be any of the Barbies that we\\'re in offer and so created her own character in a rather chaotic manner. Weird Barbie is created out of emotional expression and therfore has the ability to feel her negative emotions.She offers Barbie the choice to go back to how things were before or to go on a mission to find the source of the problem. Barbie instantly chooses to revert back and not to address the problem. Barbie embodies a toxic positivity and fear of change which prevents her from accepting or noticing the problems within her reality and within the real world. Fear of change, fear of negative emotions.In later entering the human world she encounters lots of negativity which she doesn\\'t know how to address, it\\'s not in her programming it\\'s not \"what I am made for\". Eventually, we see her sit looking out to the sea and look internally. In doing this she is able to access and feel her emotions. The fear, the insecurity, the anziety. She cries, turning to the old lady on the bench next to her she tells her she is beautiful. She has learned to see her fears, feel her feelings and feel awe at the beauty of an imperfect world.She\\'s once again crushed by the daughter who tells her succinctly what she feels about Barbie as a tool of the patriarchy and capitalism.Barbie feels her feelings.Barbie had gone into the conversation with the goal of \"fixing\" the girl who\\'d gone rouge.She learns here that she can\\'t fix the problems presented by the child because she can\\'t even begin to understand them.Retreating back into uncertainty she willingly goes back to a figure of authority, Mattel, who say they can help get her back, home safe.In Mattel HQ she finds out that these men have no idea what they\\'re doing. They want to put her back in the box, as if the world has not changed and she with it. She sees at the last moment that she can\\'t go back, there was something rotten from the beginning and she can\\'t go back in the box, she needs to figure out how to change it.She needs to figure out what she was made for.This new version of her. With the new feelings. She need to find her creator.Fortunately enough, she encounters her instantly.Her creator is the one who, when arriving back in Barbieworld, now Kenland, can effectively fight the idea of patriarchy that has infected the minds of the women.It\\'s almost like Mettel are telling us that they are listening to the voices of those fighting the patriarchy and are making a commitment to change and be different in the making of this film.Barbie gets her story ach ending when she comes to peace with her fear of death. She accepts mortality. It\\'s again as if Mattel are telling us, the idea of Barbie is not immortal and will die. And it may have died with this generation but we\\'re adapting and ready to change.Barbie, the idea, the perfect Barbie. The perfect Margot Robbie ideal Barbie. The Ideal is not real. \"I was an Ideal, look so alive, turns out it\\'s not real, what was I made for?\"The ideal must die.It would be beautiful if they discontinued the \"original\" Barbie doll after this film.The ideal never really exited.It\\'s a slightly dissatisfying ending in a way because all of the power imbalances and structural patriarchal or matriarchal in the Barbie world ideas still persist.The fascist idiology as the daughter put it.The world of women in power is confined to an imaginary world and men remain dominant in Mattel and in the real world.We don\\'t see a story arch for the society, as it never really changes. We\\'re told in a way to accept that only incremental, tiny changes are allowed and large structural reform is pushed aside as unrealistic.', \"No Spoilers:\\nI went for my daughter and a social 'ladies night' function our local cinema does for certain releases (missed them since COVID).My expectations were of a funny movie about dolls based in a 'barbie world'. Basically Live Action Toy Story Barbie.This movie was so much more than expected. It was thought provoking and gave a reflection of our society that women must endure and made way for conversations between mothers and daughters regarding how the world views women vs how they should see themselves. The idealistic Barbie world vs the real world was eye opening to young girls. The Barbie characters were diverse, intelligent and kind. The cameos, easter eggs and acting was fantastic too.Brilliant movie.\", 'Go and see it with neutrality. It is not a movie exclusively for the female audience. I have fully appreciated the way in which certain topics are addressed, such as Capitalism and Patriarchy, the stereotypes of being an attractive Woman and the problem about the toxic masculinity. At the moment it is the film that most surprised me, positively, of 2023. There\\'s a special chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie, since, when they appear together in the first scene till the last one, and when you note this detail you cannot think : \"Damn, they\\'re so gorgeous!\".Would recommend it!!!!!!', \"Listen as a woman in her 20s I am all for feminist movies but this movie really felt like a disappointment.Went in with the expectation of something only to be disappointed.The plot seems to be non-existent. Barbie has a crisis she goes to fix it but then it all becomes a mess. The dialogue feels like it's preaching rather than embodying the actual characters or the growth feels so non-existentHalf of the movie has me feeling overwhelmed and confused. It wasn't my cup of tea because of how obvious all the quotes felt. The director tried to create depth but there was no depth only this quote that felt so obvious making it even more boring.\", \"This movie is the definition of camp and fun cinema that also makes you think. I don't think I've ever laughed as much and for so long as I did when I was in the theater watching this movie. This movie is one of them where before you've even finished watching it the first time around you know you are gonna be coming back to watch it again and again. I remember watching all of the trailers and teasers and being so excited for this movie but also scared, because this could have either be the greatest movie ever or the worst movie ever. And of course it was the greatest movie ever. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to just have fun and laugh for the 2-hour run time (that flew by super quick).\", 'The Barbie movie interested me at first. I wasn\\'t expecting anything more than a silly movie with an interesting message, maybe it could\\'ve been a great way to show people the struggles of women in modern society, however this movie really disappoints.Honestly, I was enjoying this picture very much around the first act, some jokes were landing, it was silly but it seemed to have no wish of making a statement. Barbieland seemed very far from reality, and that\\'s what made it funny. Ken getting flown by the waves in the most unnatural way, just because he wants to prove himself, also his \"job\" is beach, I found that very funny.However, I was expecting the real world to be a turning point in the movie, if the real world actually seemed tonally different from Barbieland or even seem real in any way, characters like Will ferrell\\'s CEO of Mattel and the employees just make the real world feel as silly and dumb as Barbieland, though Will Ferrell is hilarious in this movie.However I would let that one slide if it wasn\\'t for other characters that feel dumb and just dumb, not funny. Like Sasha, who is a completely useless character that was introduced as this mean, depressed teenager that wants to harm everyone for no reason, however, she never again is presented this way. Somehow she is a nice girl later in the movie and even defends her mom in the rare instances of her actually saying something in the second to third act of the movie. Her mom, though, has a more important role, however she is one of the big elements that ruin this movie, her speech near the end of the second act feels like she\\'s stating the obvious and not really making a difference, however, for some reason, everyone buys it, and Barbie no longer has depression. It looks like Greta has no clue how to express depression on screen.Barbie tries to create emotional moments in a couple of scenes and in the very ending, which feel totally out of tone as I feel like Margot\\'s character really doesn\\'t have much depth and these scenes are dropped in the worst times, and are not impactful. It looks like Greta has no clue how to express depression on screen, as some moments that could\\'ve been sad are treated as jokes.When Ken figures out about patriarchy and goes back to Barbieland is where this movie shows what its true message is. The Kens end up ruling Barbieland and all the Barbies get mind-controlled, except for Margot. But then the day is saved as all the Barbies take control of Barbieland once again and the Kens remain with no power whatsoever. I see this as Greta\\'s moment of telling the audience that this movie is not for men, or she just truly believes men should shut up and let women do what they will, as equality truly is never a goal in this movie.As the narrator says \"one day the Kens will have the same rights as women in the real world\", I noticed the hatred coming along. If Barbieland symbolizes something, it would be an utopia, the perfect society. However, instead of solving the problem of this \"utopia\" by giving power to Kens and creating a true perfect balance, it comes back to status-quo by keeping Kens powerless, showing Greta\\'s real wish here. I feel it\\'s a huge mistake as the movie brings up the topic of change halfway through while not making a good example, contradicting its own morals, if they were correct in the first place.Barbie\\'s character arc is not bad but it\\'s poorly executed, it seems like it\\'s all over the place and the writers didn\\'t know how to develop her. Sometimes she is annoying, oftentimes she is dumb, but mostly her arc is based on her depression and how she feels. Though we don\\'t really feel like her, and I get confused on how the depressed doll thing works, I\\'m really confused as no other depressed person ever played with a doll before, it seems like children are seen as dull and have no emotions that matter, because if the dolls reflect their personality, then they would be dumb and never question reality as the Barbies and Kens do. But Barbie is the only one that does, and this is why she turns into a human in the end, it\\'s not a very emotional ending, it feels overly dramatic as the topics being covered and the tone of the movie doesn\\'t build up to this moment. But Barbie now living in the real world is fine, it just isn\\'t anything special.Overall this movie instigates hatred and is doing this at this very moment in real life, the polarizing nature of this movie is clear here. It\\'s lack of self-doubt and the need of proving itself correctly while not being right whatsoever makes us, who didn\\'t enjoy the movie, turn into the villains, as our opinion becomes irrelevant and can be refuted with simply: \"I bet your favorite movie is The Godfather\". I\\'m not trying to pick any side as I\\'m just giving my opinion. I respect all opinions and expect people to do the same.This movie could be fine in its own right if it wasn\\'t for the toxic and sheer irrational nature that it generates, which is a reflection of our society and the hatred we keep inside and, often, only let it out in movies such as this one. Though I\\'m looking forward to more new ideas like this one, as the industry is starting to come back with inventive and creative pictures that bring people to the cinema and generate revenue, just hoping to be better movies next time. Barbie(2023) 3/10.', 'I think everybody should watch this movie. This movie will change someones perspective of the world. If someone hates on this movie is because they did not understand the message and meaning behind it. Margot Robbie did an excellent job portraying Barbie. Would totally rewatch this movie. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me think about my childhood. Its such a beautiful movie. Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors of this generation. Truly the best movie released this year. She even broke box office record for female directors. LOVE BARBIE AND EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!', 'The whole movie is a gentle punch of love covered in perfect pink. You don\\'t have to be perfect, you are who you are, and your existence itself shall be of intrinsic value.Barbie was created to be a playmate for girls, inspiring them to grow and become outstanding and successful women in all walks of life.But in the real world, Barbie found that she had not fulfilled her mission at all. Her perfect body and appearance caused women body anxiety and appearance anxiety. Served as an accomplice to the objectification of women, she has been sugar-coated by capitalism to be propaganda for consumerism and unrealistic physical ideas, destroyed growth of innate sense of worth and has set the equal rights movement back 50 years.Barbie fell into a deep existential crisis, \"If I can\\'t fulfill my mission, what is the meaning of my existence?\"\\nThe answer given by the director comes from a place of love: \"Your existence itself has intrinsic value, you don\\'t have to earn it, and you have every right to define the meaning of your existence.\"When I looked at the QQ Music Original Soundtrack comment section, I realized that many audience have been moved to tears, so was I especially during below parts:1. A conversation between Barbie and an old woman on a bench at a bus stop.In the world where Barbie lives, there is no aging or death, and everyone is always young and exquisite. When she came to the real world, she met an old lady, and for the first time she looked at this face full of wrinkles, and said sincerely, \" You are beautiful\", which represents her acceptance of aging and the imperfect being of the world, and also represents she has been able to make her own definition of beauty for the very first time ever, and this is the first step for her innate sense of self to emerge.For a long time, in the perfect Barbieland/narratives of consumerism, only perfect and exquisite high heels and clothes, slim and graceful figure and face, decent residence and cars and luxurious parties are beauty. But this time, Barbie defines beauty in a different way by herself.Only when she truly accepts herself, the self who doesn\\'t like high heels, has cellulite on her legs, will age and die, will be confused and sad, can she truly accept the outside world and other people without criticism. And only by true acceptance of the world, other people and herself, one can generate genuine respect. Only then can she look at the old grand lady\\'s hunched back and wrinkled face, and still think it is beautiful.In my opinion, apart from aging, sickness and death, all other worries in life are merely a matter of values, but aging, sickness and death have no solution. Being able to reconcile with aging is not only the calmness of watching one\\'s vitality disappear little by little, but also the courage to face the countdown to death, and the courage to accept this helplessness and cherish every minute of life even more.This reminds me of a related story. Long, long ago, in a faraway land, a king received a prophecy that his son would either become the greatest king ever lived in history or become an unprecedented spiritual leader. The king thought of the thin, poor and sloppy practitioners wandering around he has seen in the past, and was very afraid that his son would abandon the road of ruling and become such, so he built an exquisite, luxurious and enclosed pavilion for him, a walled garden of earthly delights and endless enjoyment. Only the healthy, the young and the happy were allowed inside. Immersed in the pleasures of senses, the prince came of age, protected from the limitations of mortal being and signs of decay and aging. But one day the prince grew curious of outside and wanted to travel outside. So the king ordered all the elderly, sick or dying people to hide at home during the prince\\'s visit. But during his visit outside, God deliberately sent an old man to hobble alongside the road and appeared in the prince\\'s sight. The prince saw an old man for the first time, realized the existence of aging for the first time, and the world and the paradise he once knew collapsed upon him. Then he ran back to his palace with shock and despair. Just like children, when they encountered troubles outside, were bullied, they\\'d run home to let their parents solve the problem, but this time, no one\\'s parents couldn\\'t solve this trouble, not even if his father was the king of the whole universe, he still could not protect his son from the knowledge of mortality. Later, in order to free the world from the suffering of life, aging, sickness and death, the prince resolutely abandoned everything and embarked on the road of no return. After going through all kinds of hardships and dangers, he finally nirvana and became an unprecedented spiritual leader.2. Barbie observed the environment in the park on the bench alone and felt the strong and various emotions of human beings for the first time. The warmth of sunlight, the mottled tree shadows, and the gentle breeze of wind. Barbie shed a tear. Cause before this, she had never felt these emotions, now she has felt what it was like to be alive for the very first time.The human world is not only filles with happiness, but also anxiety, sadness, and helplessness. But it\\'s all those lows that make those happy moments all the more precious.3. Warmth of your gaze:Ken was created as an accessory to Barbie, who would always stand on the beach waiting for Barbie to say hello to him. He has no home, no friends, no job, no ideals, no ego. Ken symbolizes lovestruck girls who lost their sense of self. He projects the ideals and the fantasies of the best qualities a person can have onto a specific person who he does not know yet, making this person an ever-judging God. For him, only when Barbie\\'s eyes are on him, is he happy. Barbie\\'s rejection has validated his miserable existence. But this is not true love. This is why when Barbie said to Ken, \"you must discover who you are without me\", this feels so warm, it\\'s the movie\\'s gentle message to all girls who are deeply troubled by love to find their self again.It\\'s not Barbie and Ken\\nIt\\'s not Ken and Barbie\\nIt\\'s Barbie and it\\'s Ken4. At the end, the conversation between Barbie and the founder Ruth is like a kid and a benevolent old mother. The background music of \"What was I made for\" only made it harder to hold my tears. For those who have been or are looking for the meaning of life, this scene would strike you. \"You created me, don\\'t you control me? Don\\'t I need your permission to be a human?\" If there\\'s higher existence who created us, does he hope to give us complete freedom to choose our beliefs, our values, our actions? And by freedom, I mean, he does not rely on miracles, or bread, or promises of heaven to lure us, to guide us, but to allow us to choose completely freely. And can we afford the heavy burdens of this freedom? So many people couldn\\'t bear it and choose various biased ideologies to get rid of the pain of independent thinking, to get rid of the loneliness of finding meaning in the context of nihilism.In the end, Barbie\\'s ending is also the most inspiring story ending ever, because she didn\\'t choose to stay in Eden-like Barbieland, but chose to become a real human. Seeing that the human world is imperfect, is filled with anxiety and sadness, aging and death, she still chooses this path. Because what she wants is an adventure, so compelling that the pain and suffering of life, as well as the aging and death, would all become worthwhile. Only in this way can she feel her own existence-no longer a manufactured thing, but the creator of her own destiny, the definer of her own meaning.Humans only have one ending, but ideas flew forever.And Barbie has no ending.', 'Going to the cinema is a waste of money if you just not want only watch Margot. Barbie certainly had the potential for an original and fresh adventure musical, but alas. Unfortunately, even well-chosen actors, well-written songs or an original and fresh visual cannot save a completely tragic scenario.A mess of banal clichés and a completely wasted opportunity. With such a budget, a cast and an interesting iconic toy, it should have been handled better.The film has a very interesting and brisk first half, but from the second it drags on at a disgusting pace.Even worse is the completely inappropriate, overblown and absurd push towards feminism.', 'The Barbie movie was a fun movie that lacked a little bit in plot, but was overall a hilarious movie to watch. While many people out there seem to hate this movie for empowering women and taking down men, they are looking at it the wrong way, they movie gave an in depth tour into all the common stereotypes set on women and men and intensified them to show their true meanings and how people can become affected by them, all while keeping the Barbie theme at the heart of the plot. It addressed and took down many of the common stereotypes and truly exposed the reality of society for what it really is, a patriarchy, which isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing however the movie is sure to make clear that women should and can have a more equal presence in \"powerful\" positions in society.', 'When I heard that a \"Barbie\" movie was coming out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it, never mind watching it in an actual movie theatre. I had every Barbie doll as a young girl in the 60\\'s, even Allen. Barbie was definitely NOT my role model, and I am thankful for the live women who were. My daughter went to see it with friends last week and convinced me to see it, because it wasn\\'t what I would expect. I am so glad that I did not wear mascara! I was in tears laughing yet totally moved by the message. A movie that is both inspiring and funny is truly rare. The cast and the message were perfect. Talk about \"Girl Power\"!', \"I grew up watching Barbie, my kids watched every Barbie movie. This was AWFUL! Extremely dumb, language was uncalled for (mother Bleep, vagina, penis, I'd like to see the blob in his jeans), on top of Mattel being made something it isn't. Where are all the other Barbie characters? Ryan, Raquelle, Summer, or her little sisters? At many points I was either yawning or asking myself why am I continuing to sit through this? I took up for the movie and told people it couldn't be that bad they were just being too judge-mental. Na I was wrong! It's terrible and I can't say that enough. You failed us!!\", \"The movie is entertaining, funny and it does touches on more serious topics, there is times that it feels that those topics are too on the face and can ruin the passing but is rarely noticeable.The way that the characters evolution is natural and interesting and I can sympathise with a lot of the characters.Is a fun movie and making a Barbie movie a pg13 is a really risky but innovative way of representing this iconic character\\nIs also really important to notice that the movie because of its nature is going to cause a lot of polarisation and hate, I think that the movie could have been more subtle on delivering the ideology but I understand why they didn't do it.\", \"I did not like this movie. I went because of the good reviews but I should have known it was all the hype. I went thinking it would be fun but it was a letdown. I almost walked out and expected more but it never happened. I can't believe that anyone would give this move a good review. It was so cheesy. The sexual undertones are a bit too much for many young kids I saw in the theatre. I would not take any children under 14 to this movie. This is definitely not a kid movie. I loved Margot Robbie in the Wolves of WallStreet and with Babylon a huge flop this is another big letdown. They spent so much money on advertising this film and it is no surprise to me now on why they had to spend so much money because this move would have flopped if they didn't spend so much money on advertising. Now after seeing it I am sick of seeing barbie.\", \"The movie is amazing, Margot Robbie gives an amazing performance and the ending is unique and has somewhat of a Truman show vibe for me , Ryan Gosling is amazing as Ken and overall the cast is phenomenal in their roles. However, I feel like the plot is at some places a little bit weak and it feels as though this film sets out on a crusade to educate you on the injustices in the real world and does mainly focus on feminism and issues surrounding that topic but it does also cover topics that aren't specific to feminism. Overall, I do not mind the role of feminism in this story and the mother daughter relationship as well as the whole female focused parts of this movie because it is simply amazing and at the end of the day we have to consider this is a movie about Barbie so all those topics are perfectly acceptable in this movie. For example, if this was a movie about some traditionally boyhood toy you would expect it to embrace that in its narrative. In conclusion, I feel as though this deserves a much higher rating then 7.8 for me personally at least a 8.5 or higher therefore I have decided to put 10/10 so the average is higher and the movie is rated properly.\", \"The movie was unexpectedly fun starting from all the references related to the actual Barbie doll to the costumes and till even the Barbie world itself. Overall I think there is a good balance between satire and sincerity, crammed with impeccable attention to details. Even tough as a watcher I expected Barbie to be the star of the show, in many moments Ken was actually such a fun scene-stealer that at one point I felt the movie should truly be Barbie and Ken.I could totally agree to the fact that the movie is a riotous, candy colored feminist fable and it's true that Barbie does many of the things we've been promised: there is much mocking and loving of Barbie, and plenty of costumes but none of those things make it subversive. From my point of view it's a movie that enormously pleased with itself but even tough it's very pretty it's not that very deep.\", \"The camp in the movie was creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 10/10. Having a character yell at you for two minutes about how hard being a woman is isn't creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 1/10.But I still did love the movie. I was laughing throughout most of the movie. The sets, the costumes, the small jokes were all so wonderful. The Barbie world feels totally separate and complete. Ryan Gosling was really the star of the movie for me. Every moment he was on screen I loved it. The moments I didn't love, were really hard to get through. I loved the take of Barbieland being a total matriarchy, but I really didn't need to be beaten over the head with a stick for two minutes to get the point they were trying to make.\", 'This is the kind of movie I want my teenage daughter to grow up watching. To get to know and appreciate the flaws, strengths, and weaknesses that come with being a woman, whatever it is, \\'Because Barbie can be anything, WE can be anything\\'.I expected the movie Barbie to be about the origin of Barbie or about Barbie\\'s adventures like most other Barbie animated movies, but it turned out to be much more than that. It really explores the value of empowering women, which is typical of Greta Gerwig.I really enjoyed the first half of the film, mainly because of the beautiful scenery, colorful colors, and Barbieland. I was also surprised by how gorgeous Margot Robbie looks as Barbie, and the costumes and set designs are so beautiful. As the movie progresses, I realized that this movie will become more profound and emotional, and Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken, handsome, funny, and energetic. Even though Ken is \"Kenough,\" the film does not ignore the role of men, and we love Allan. The movie is a bit dull at times, and some of the jokes are cringey, but it\\'s still enjoyable to watch to the end.I think the best part of the movie is the ending, when Barbie talks to Ruth in a really meaningful way. It\\'s really touching and uplifting, with a really thoughtful message about womanhood and self-love.Barbie (2023) might not be perfect and it might not be everyone\\'s favorite, but hey, nothing\\'s perfect, right?-@fineapplespov.', 'First, let me say there are some laughs in this movie and I enjoyed some of the comedy. Absolutely fun for kids and family (minus the sexual innuendos and sexual jokes). Honestly I believe this movie is making money cus of the brand alone. Visually this movie is appealing. Yes. Absolutely. Straight out of the toy stores and out of the Barbie toy boxes. Story wise this movie is a dump. Mediocre at best. Feminist heavy which is fine, but the story itself is what makes it a dump. It makes no sense. If you\\'re expecting a Lego movie or Free Guy type of reveal, there is not one. The humans literally just cross over to \"Barbieland\" and Barbie herself is able to stay in the \"human\" world which is apparently a skip and a jump away from the city. This makes the movie seem like it\\'s Disney channel material and not really Disney theater material. It\\'s a Barbie movie so I wasn\\'t expecting much but to not explain why and how everyone is able to just crossover to \"Barbieland\" is bad writing. The main character draws a sad Barbie and it makes Barbie in the nearby very real \"Barbieland\" sad. Barbie can somehow feel her emotions. So with no explanation why, Barbie is supposed to be a doll but is also real and has a connection to this woman who\\'s works for Mattel and draws Barbie in her free time. Mattel CEO\\'s can also crossover to \"Barbieland\" and it\\'s normal. This side of the story is terrible. Aside from the obvious feminist storyline there is no other story that makes sense. It\\'s all just Disney channel silliness. The final scene serves no purpose other than to serve for another inside sexual joke. So dumb.The Oscar talk surrounding this movie is absurd. As a real movie, it\\'s a terrible movie. While Gosling is funny here, should he be nominated for playing a silly, sad Ken doll? Literally anyone could have played these roles. There was nothing Oscar worthy in these performances. Gosling has turned in some great performances in his career but this is just not one of them. Nominating him would be equivalent to nominating Kurt Russell for his role in Sky High. Nothing outstanding.Of course women and little girls will find this movie entertaining. Thanks to nostalgia and the visually appealing sets it will connect with most females. Is it really Oscar worthy? I\\'d say no. There is no real acting done in this movie. Nominating this movie for anything other than visual, costumes and/or sets, would be an insult to the actors that have truly acted in some amazing roles.Should you watch this movie? Sure. Why not. Like I said it\\'s visually appealing and is funny, and is feminist heavy. Most women should and will most likely enjoy this movie. Anyone with a sense of story telling, might not. I would suggest watching Free Guy, and the Lego movie. Much better stories being told there that actually do make sense.', \"Was absolutely amazing. Barbie came to life, it felt exactly like when I was a kid. It brings a deeper more meaningful message without being too harsh. I love how it brings the 2 worlds and perspectives together, it really got me thinking. When barbie goes to the real word, I truely felt like I could relate, as if it was speaking to me and probably most women out there. It's definitely a movie for those who love as well as hate barbie. Its a 10 out of 10 for me. Everyone must see this to gain perspective, a doll's world so completely mirroring our own. Also, the toys of this movie is amazing, a must see.\", \"I went into Barbie with no expectations, only hopes that it would be entertaining, even if the intended audience is pretty young. Well, I was wrong about the age of the intended audience because obviously the intended audience is me and my fellow 80's babies/90's teens! I absolutely loved it and definitely entertained. I laughed, got teary eyed, and even cheered at times. Margot Robbie shined, Ryan Gosling gave me a new perspective on Ken, and the costumes dazzled. The themes, jokes, and one-liners were actually pretty insightful. Barbie Movie is not all pretty fluff and makeup. It's the MOMENT.\", \"Greta Gerwig should be proud of herself and so should everyone involved in the making of Barbie because it was such a great film . I watched Barbie on the first day it came out and the cinema was packed, when it got to the scene where the Mum was telling the Barbie's what it's really like to be a woman the audience were clapping because they agreed and it creates such a lovely atmosphere that I've never been in or felt at the cinema . Many people who haven't watched the movie seem to have a problem with it because they think it's just about feminism when it's now because when the Barbie's eventually got there power back they didn't create a matriarchy like the Ken's creating a patriarchy but they found a way to live as close to equally as they could. Overall, Barbie is a great film and you should watch it no matter what anybody says because you will feel changed in a sort of way that you can't put into words after seeing it.\", \"I had high expectations as a result of the media press, however these we're crushed from the start.First of all, I did expect it to feel a little generic and cheesy although all I could feel throughout the movie is that it was rushed and cheap. The storyline was dry and over-political.I'd have liked to see more LGBTQ+ representation and breaking stereotypes, as it felt like just a generic film. Even the Barbies were considered stereotypes!Comedy throughout was limited and wasn't engaging at all - sometimes trying too hard to emphasise feminism and going too far in the opposite direction to the world is heading in (I'm not encouraging patriarchy).However, I did find the music quite good (especially the Billie Eilish song) and did redeem the movie a little bit.In summary, the movie was mediocre at best and there's not much to discuss. It felt like a cheap version of movies like Spirited and The Greatest Showman with no real emotion.\", 'Great costumes and set, but the Barbie land was not fully exposed instead they chose to make every single scene in the movie a political stand. After half an hour is stared to feel like ever other generic Hollywood movies. Everyone in the movie theatre was trying so hard to enjoy the movie, but all there expectations were crushed. No one laughed at the supposedly funny scenes. It was a dread. Dude people go to a Barbie movie to have fun, we have social media to preach about political issues everyday. Everyone fighting for every minute sign of offensive remarks. News anchors and politicians virtue signalling. Where will people go to have fun, Hollywood deserve to go broke.', '\"Barbie (22023)\" takes Barbie on an awesome space adventure, set in the future. The movie has stunning visuals as Barbie faces cosmic challenges with bravery and smarts. It teaches us the importance of understanding others and being true to ourselves.The film gives a fresh twist to the classic Barbie story, with an exciting intergalactic journey. Barbie makes new alien friends and learns about empathy and unity, making strong bonds across time and space. The movie\\'s message is heartwarming, encouraging us to be ourselves and embrace change as we follow Barbie\\'s cosmic encounters.\"Barbie (22023)\" reminds us why Barbie is a role model, inspiring people with her charm and never-give-up attitude. It\\'s an inspiring adventure that stays with you, showing us the power of believing in ourselves and growing. Get ready for a fun and futuristic ride that brings back the magic of Barbie in an amazing new way, keeping the timeless spirit alive for generations to come.', 'We saw a pre-screening of the Barbie movie last night. I loved the walk down memory lane and some new facts about the history of Barbie scattered through the film. There were great messages around what feminism really is but also how when one gender holds all the power it\\'s not a good balance. The actors were brilliant and Ryan Gosling\\'s portrayal of Ken was just perfection. Margot Robbie made the perfect \"stereotypical\" Barbie but took us on an emotional ride of discovery. All in all it was an enjoyable movie with a great script. Great for Barbie fans and anyone who has a connection to Barbie from their childhoods!', \"Barbie struggles to both identify and captivate the audience. Who is it written for? Whist there is one laugh out loud moments; with Sugar Daddy Barbie, the movie seems too drawn out and drags at times. Despite having important themes about misogyny, you can't help feel that a bit more subtlety would have got the message across. Whilst empowering the female characters and making them well rounded, the male characters come across as macho stereotypes. I was looking forward to seeing future Doctor Who Ncuti Gatwa, but it was more of a blink and you will miss it. Rather than a message of equality, you are left feeling this has a women are superior message.On a positive note, though, the movie is a great homage to the history of Barbie and it is very much about spotting the discontinued Barbie products. It also shows young girls that they can be ambitious and anything is possible.\", 'As a woman and a feminist I was disappointed by this. The actors were great - Margot and Ryan doing their best - but they can only work what they\\'re given and the \"story\" was wafer thin and made no sense. This would have been OK if it was a movie aimed at kids but it wasn\\'t and I would imagine children would be bored even quicker than I was. It\\'s lovely to look at, the clothes and sets replicating the Barbie world so beautifully but it\\'s very much style over substance and the jokes are laboured and repetitive. If it was just a lighthearted giggle for the girls I would have enjoyed it more but the second half is full of dreary speeches and millisecond cameos (Rob Brydon) that added nothing but a nod to the cleverness of the directors research skills.', \"I think Greta Gerwig perfectly threaded the needle between astute social commentary on Barbie, and a love letter to the doll that shaped America. It is a campy oasis in the midst of an industry that seems to increasingly worship somber realism. It has all the charm of an 80s cult classic, on a 2023 budget. Alongside hilarious writing that made my cheeks hurt by the end, is incredible set and costume design, and standout acting performances from a remarkably cohesive cast. There are also subtle details I really appreciated like Barbie's car being a 1959 corvette, the same year the doll was released. I'll knock one star off because in a few moments towards the end, the plot gets lost in itself, and it feels like they are speaking in riddles.\", \"I was VERY excited to see Barbie and I expected SO much. I feel like I got more of the unexpected, and less of what I expected, though I don't really know what I expected.Songs...\\nI loved the mix of already existing songs and customed songs for this movie. I adored Billie Eilishs song What Was I Made For, it was so touching.The fighting scene with all the Kens at the beach was ridiculously amazing, and Ryan Gosling has never looked better, hehe. I loved the choreography in that big space with blue and pink, Ken Can. Music was 10/10.Emotion...\\nWhen Barbie saw what the real world was like I felt tears running down my face, I was so hurt by the truth. I mean, not even in this Barbie movie, we can forget about the unfair world for women. But without it, the movie wouldn't be as great.A big part of the movie was emotional and I thought that was great. When they talked about death, I really felt it.Overall, the movie was way more than I thought it would be and I definitely recommend it. The humor isn't hilarious but I chuckled when jokes were relatable.\", 'I watched the Barbie movie last night. Overall I would say that it\\'s a very creative dare I say, outstanding, movie. The premise is brilliant albeit kind of uncomfortable with its generalization of gender roles and what I\\'d like to think were hyperbolic stereotypes. But, I am a guy and I definitely have my blind spots as many know. However I do try to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. After all I do have many capable and strong women in my life that I\\'m concerned whether they get treated fairly.But, despite these slightly unsettling misgivings it\\'s a really funny movie. The mixed animation and live action is remarkable and many of the characters are really well written. That is aside from the male characters; they\\'re all pretty much one dimensional dullards who generally can\\'t get out of their own way. Thus it\\'s a mix of humorous social commentary with keystone cop slapstick. But it\\'s so visually rich it\\'s like a cinematic ice cream sundae.Margot Robbie was made for this role. Her performance was a combination of sweet naivete and compelling poignancy. And she looks like a Barbie. That\\'s remarkable. Many of the other \"Barbie\" dolls were performed excellently as well. Kate McKinnon is really funny in it even though it seemed at times she was adlib/riffing a la SNL with one eye on the audience, but she\\'s very good as the bad(?) Barbie. I was surprised and pleased to see John Cena make an appearance or two as the Neptune Ken; that was pretty funny.Both Ryan Gosling and Simon Liu were good as Ken and . . . Well, Ken. Their characters actually had a little depth to them which allowed them to grow (a little) over the course of the story. America Ferrera is a good actor and she was solid but not compelling. For my taste her climatic speech(es) were heavy-handed but they did serve a story development purpose.So, in short I really enjoyed the movie. It was visually compelling and much of the acting outstanding. While the story may rankle some OGs out there, for anyone who was/is married or has a daughter or a sister or a mother (I guess that\\'s everyone) they know that women often times have suffered from gender bigotry and so being sympathetic to that I think they\\'ll find it is a really good movie. And there\\'s probably nothing wrong with being reminded of that struggle now and then.Oh, and the music. It\\'s got a great soundtrack. And the final song \"What Was I Made For?\" written by both Billie Eilish and Finneas O\\'Connell and sung by Billie stopped me in my tracks. What a well written song that was so apropos and memorable.', 'Went yesterday to the movie theaters to saw Barbie after i read a lot of positive reviews. However, it was not my cup of tea. I saw sometimes a funny moment (most of the time because of Will Ferrell) but the other jokes were a bit cringe. I guess the target audience is focused on woman instead of men? In my theater the woman had a laugh and the men kinda waited for it to end...What else? I dont know. Margot and Ryan gave their best and they did pretty alright.The big message that the movie wanted to bring over was a bit long over explained. I am not sure i understood it in the end... also... was not sure i even bothered to give it any thinking.In the end i just wanted to go home.', \"The movie did something that has never been done before. The details, the music, comedy, and my favourite.... the outifts!!! I could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a Barbie. I truly reccomend you warching this film, not only it is entertaining, but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself. The movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worse.I have no doubt that this is the best Greta Gerwig's movie yet and I hope in the future she will spoil us with more fascinating stuff.\", \"In a fun, visually stunning, simplistic way, Barbie captures the audience with nostalgia and bright color schemes. With a plethora of Barbie styles, versions, and callouts to real accessories, Barbie proves to peak the interest of the audience and bring humor with short quips and comments by the characters and narrator. It has a strong opening that establishes the make-believe world and sets a quick witted tone to the movie, mixing slap stick comedy with deeper philosophical undertones.However, after establishing main character\\nBarbie and side-kick Ken characters well, and showing a clear direction in the first quarter of the film, humor is exchanged for harsh reality in the second quarter, with no real relief or solution given to the audience. As the movie moves into the third quarter, mixed messaging seems to have feminist roots, but fails to address real issues for the common, moderate feminist. There are several chances in the film in which the main character, Barbie, can and does acknowledge the imbalance between men and women, but fails to provide a bonding, peaceful solution to the imbalance. Furthermore, it doubles down on the more radical, one sided views of modern feminism, aiming to make one gender (men) incompetent, while promoting the other gender (women) as the best leadership solution for a competently run, balanced society. At one point a main character, other than Barbie, has a minutes long soliloquy outlining all the troubles of women today, yet solutions are never presented and the end result feels more like complaining than empowerment.The last fourth of the movie seems to complete the fall away from the light heartedness of the opening, which was actually one of the strengths (and expectations) of the film. Slap stick, awkward, one liner comedy remains throughout, but while watching, the audience's confusion about the message only allows for chuckles instead of all out laughs. Some comedy ends up falling flat from obvious missed payoffs or opportunities to instill the uniting of genders as a solution. Instead, the film awkwardly seems to support the notion that one sided governance is acceptable as long as it is the side that the writers deem proper. In this case it is clearly women, but almost coldly so, as if leaving out the core feminist movement completely. If Barbie was meant to leave the audience with a feeling of hope for the future, it certainly missed the mark. On-the-nose propaganda was not what the audience came to see, but is what they received, regardless of how humorous any scene attempted to be.The best aspect of the movie are convincing performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is well over shadowed, or more accurately, over powered by Gosling's Ken. Unfortunately the character arc for Barbie was completed but underwhelming, while the character arc for Ken was expansive but confusing. Both characters seemed to miss the moral growth mark, leaving the audience wondering if any lessons had been learned at all.In summary, strong visual presence, humor, and performances kept this film from being a total flop due to the over exaggerated and misguided social commentary forced on the viewer. What should have been a light hearted, fun, uniting feel-good film, was indeed a well put together, visually stunning, mildly funny piece of propaganda for Mattel playing dress up in a modern feminist costume that only a Barbie doll could get away with.\", 'I never had high expectations for the film due to the number of just-okay films that have come out this past year, but Greta never disappoints- Lady Bird, Little Women, and now Barbie! The movie is surely a Gerwig classic. It is amazing how the outright un-serious, campy film is able to tackle such serious and complicated real-world issues. Naturally, there is a satirical exaggeration of society to convey the point of the story but was executed with a conceptually clever approach. The writing carried witty humor, strong character development, and heartfelt experiences- all shined ever so brightly with the array of superb performances. Margot Robbie\\'s performance throughout the film revealed the depth of such a character that can often be seen as superficial. The same can be said for Ryan Gosling\\'s Ken. (SPOILERS) It is clear that everything Ken has done to Barbieland (\"bringing patriarchy\") was in a way to shape his own sense of identity and self worth, what he feels he often lacks in Barbieland. The film features a multitude of well-known actors that portray a great deal of what a Barbie can be. The set and costumes bring viewers the nostalgia of their childhoods and how this life in a Barbie dream house (and her clothes) were extremely coveted by young girls. On the other hand, it shows how Barbieland is not all it is thought out to be. I was pleasantly surprised at how the dance numbers were reminiscent of old Hollywood sound-stage musicals that we never really see anymore. This film review would not be complete without an honorable mention to America Ferrera\\'s performance. Her monologue\\'s feminist themes are reminiscent of Saorise Ronan\\'s monologue from Little Women. It was delivered at just the right pacing and intensity, resonating with audiences. While the message is not at all new, many women especially feel heard. The film does a wonderful job of blending the inclusive comedy with previous or subsequent scenes that make viewers tear up- the simultaneous laughing and crying sort. Overall, \"Barbie\" is a fun, glittery, social commentary satire about female identity; the feminism of hyperfemininity, authenticity, and community; and what it means to be human in our messed-up, chaotic world. For the Gerwig fans, Barbie lovers, Barbie haters, and everyone else, go watch Barbie.', 'How I Saw It... Barbie.From the opening notes of Also Sprach Zarathustra, an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey\\'s The Dawn of Man, I was impressed. I knew that Gerwig was going take me for subversive ride on Barbie roller-coaster.Greta\\'s humour and satire are in fine form.One scene tugged at my heart: Barbie (Robbie) is sitting at bus stop, and makes eye contact with an elderly woman, and says in absolute awe, \"You\\'re beautiful.\"\\nThe woman looks at her and says matter-of-factly, \"I know it.\"She succeeded tearing down the stereotypical Barbie image, and replacing it with real woman. No small feat.', \"Actually incredible!!This film made me laugh, smile & cry.It has an amazing deeper meaning that many people overlook\\n& The cast in this film are sooo talented!!It has an amazing soundtrack featuring artists like Charlie xcx, tame impala & lizzo!I would recommend this film for tweens+ since anyone younger wouldn't probably understand the concept of the film.Here are a few of my fav moments (spoilers)weird barbieAllanthe cellulite jokeswhen the Barbies got their power backI'm just Ken & all the other songsbarbie & Ruththe (real) home videosthe jokes against the patriarchyThat's all :)\", \"From the opening scenes alluding to the greatest film of all time, this movie was captivating, witty, hilarious, aesthetic, philosophical, surreal, unapologetically feminine and feminist. Just masterful filmmaking that made every minute a delight to watch, and made you look forward to rewatching it. It pulled no punches in criticism of capitalism and patriarchy. I don't agree with Criticism that it was a commercial for Mattel since they clearly gave Greta final edit. Really don't can't think of a bad thing to say. But I do think that this movie felt like a cultural reset, that it has changed movies forever in the best possible way.\", 'While there were definitely some funny parts, they were too few to outweigh the other annoyingly cheesy jokes thrown around. The actors seemed a bit on the older side but the overall movie did not appear to be an \"adult movie\". I feel that it tried to find a balance for kids and adults but in the end fell short for both. Some bits were too long for my taste and the plot seemed to go back and forth too much between the Barbie and the real world. I did not have high expectations but what did help me watch through the movie were the strong messages for our generation that were heartfelt and genuine.', \"I know that Barbie is for Toy Story 2 3 and 4 but this Barbie is something else like a doctor, a sports girl, a cow girl in the city. Barbie is being used as a toy. From the beginning of the movie the kids started to break tea cups, tables and baby dolls. Barbie went to ugly Barbie to go to the real world to find her kid. I surprised that Barbie had a memory of her kid who used to play with her that she doesn't n't like anymore. So Ken takes over Barbie island while Barbie lies down on the floor like a toy. Barbie and the other girls makes the boys go to war. The old lady and Barbie thought about a little girl who loved playing with Barbie so much.\", \"Greta Gerwig brings the fun to the well known toy of generations, Barbie. Based on the trailers and interviews my hopes were high that it was going to be a fun and campy ride in the Barbie mobile. I would say it hit a few speed bumps. Women empowerment and understanding Barbie was spot on. Bringing in the discontinued dolls and ideas was brilliant. I feel the Kens' storyline was were the potholes were. Why can't it be Barbie's world and not so strong on a beating over the head that Ken is nothing. That Ken's only recourse is to take over? That Ken in the end, still isn't supporting Barbie as it should be. That might be controversial and some might say I missed the point, but I want my son to see it and come away with equality not that he should be diminished. If we want equality we need to model what a supportive boy/man should be. Partnership anybody?\", \"Whenever someone says they disliked the movie most people tell them it's because they are not getting the plot correctly or they simply don't get feminism. I am a girl and a feminist and this movie was all marketing, ik i'm not saying something new. It was a cute story but half of the dialogues were bad/kinda cringy. Also, many relationships were presented to us, for example the mom and her daughter, and the movie never bothered to show us a little backstory, it had potential. At least I really appreciated that the main purpose of the movie was to show women everyday struggles, loved the monologue.I think it's a nice movie, but not worth the hype like to watch it in the cinema.\", \"Had high hopes for this one but man it just wasn't funny to me at all and I love to laugh. I suppose maybe this was too smart a humor for me seeing that I'm a woman in her fifties with middle school boy humor (think The Hangover, Million Ways to Die in the West). Maybe Barbie's message-based 'humor' went over my head but man I couldn't wait for this one to be over. And that speech the mom made toward the end that everyone is singing the praises of? It was pure cringe. More power to those who found this movie to be cinema gold but I'll stick with Seth McFarland for my humor, thank you very much.\", \"A beautiful light tale about the development and conditioning of identity and self esteem and how it can lead to stereotypical behavior and dependency in relationships. But also how a person can get the intuition that it feels better to make a choice for another direction in one's life. The first steps in this new direction starts with a new physical sensation in your feet and emotional associations about getting older and dying in the end. Like in 'The Little Mermaid' you have to sacrifice things that were important to you but once you stepped into this new world it feels like being born for the second time. Superb movie.\", 'I was positively surprise. I never write reviews, but I loved the movie. Was funny, the acting was amazing and it kept me so entertained ! Thank you Barbie! I really recommend everyone to watch it, I am happy I did.The movie was moving, funny, deep, refreshing. The acting of Ryan Gosling was impeccable. But the whole cast did such an amazing job too.The movie has comedy and touches of musical. Its a complete surprise. I would definitely watch it again.If you are undecided and you think this is a kid movie. It is not. And it is worth the tome. You will leave happy.Its Barbie and Its Ken !', \"A breath of fresh air from almost all movies made in the past 10 years. Great acting, amazing set designs and a wonderfully interesting story with a few twists! I've been so turned off with many of the movies made in the past 10 years due to poor storylines, and an extreme over abundance of CGI, which I'm guessing most people like because that's the bulk of movies nowadays. This movie had me smiling or laughing most of the time, with a few heartfelt moments which brought a tear or two to my eyes. Congratulations to the writer, producer, Director and cast as it was an amazing movie all around - loved it.\", 'This movie did a lot of things good and a lot of things bad.It left me from the theater feeling more emotions than Oppenheimer. Those emotions being anger and frustration.The movie was aesthetically very precise in the way that it felt like they had a specific vision for it. It reminded me a bit of what Toy Story would look like in live action. It leave the audience ponder over the significance of the movie, which I have heard a lot. There were a lot of moments where the film was heading in the right direction but I felt they haven\\'t fully explored those ideas. It felt like a waste potential when Barbie goes into the real world and sees how women are \"supposedly\" treated. This is no new concept and feels a bit exaggerate and not addressing the real challenges women face in society. I feel we have pass ahead of what was being portrayed. The monologue with the mother to the Barbies did feel relatable and wish those concepts were explored a bit more than just being repeated again.When Ken brings back patriarchy to Barbieland and the barbies take it back by manipulating and tricking the Kens felt very cheap. What was the message behind that. At the end of the movie nothing changed. Barbie did become a fascist and took over Barbieland and were back to square one. Maybe that was the message, that nothing will ever change. The Ken are to Barbieland what women are to the real world.Except for stereotypical Barbie having thoughts of death and cellulite (that plotline was then abandoned and never mentioned), all the Barbies were supposedly perfect and didn\\'t have any flaws, which is the point, but if you want to portray realistic women, why did all the barbies at the end became the same as before? There was no progress done. There was only weird Barbie that felt human since it has \"bad\" and \"good\" characteristics but it felt like she was only a tour guide than an actual character.Perhaps that\\'s the message of the movie, that there can be no progress, which this movie was really good at getting conversations started since there are so many mixed opinionsThis whole movie also felt like a whole 2-hours long commercial on Barbie. The whole marketing campaign made it feel like you fell in the trap of what this movie was trying to avoid, capitalism consumerist society, yet the sells for Barbie will increase.The monologue with Barbie and the creator felt forced like those motivational speeches trying to force the message to the audience instead of thinking and coming to that conclusion.There were more than a few awkward moments that didn\\'t need to be in the movie that felt unnecessary.The casting for Barbie was spot on but I would not agree for Ken. It didn\\'t make sense for Ryan Gosling to be Ken, although no complain from the acting obviously, but just didn\\'t fit. The hair looked awkward and distracting and wasn\\'t a portrayal of the youth Ken.At the end, I think it\\'s also a huge generalization and don\\'t know if this is the right movie for feminism and equality. I expected more from this movie.', \"This movie should have been for free and on the hallmark channel. So sappy, and preachy. It felt like it was trying too hard to get the message across when it could have been orchestrated better. Also all this hype and getting people to wear pink and excited for Barbie movie when the movie itself was completely opposite of the original Barbie. Like we get it, women have insecurities blah blah blah. We all know this. You didn't make us realize this in the movie. Idk in my opinion not worth spending your money to go watch this movie, just wait for it to go on Netflix and watch it at home!!!!!!!!\", \"The first 5 min 👌🏽!!!Not a second of the movie looses your attention, it makes you think, laugh and even got a little tear out. It's full of irony and sarcasm, visually amazing. The level of detail on the toys, clothes, etc!!If you think it's just a feminist movie, give it a chance, if your smart enough to understand and read into the details, it will make you se a different perspective on what's feminism actually mean.I don't think it's inappropriate for kids however, they have to be certain age to understand the movie!This is already pop culture icon, hopefully opening minds in every generation!\", \"Grandiose movie: colourful, lovingly staged, entertaining, definitely strange but never trashy. The actors are brilliant, the dialogue to the point and the set design fantastic. It had everything: I laughed, I was thoughtful, I cried. My husband was also thrilled. Great cinema has been achieved here, from which everyone can certainly take something away, whether they are Barbie fans or not. I was excited to see the film because of the director and for me Greta Gerwig's masterful skills have been confirmed. Thank you for 114 minutes of escapism without ever losing sight of reality. For me, the best film so far in 2023.\", \"As a huge Barbie fan I was first sceptic, but as the movie trailers came out I got more and more enthousiastic. The movie was a big 10 for me. The jokes, the costumes, the actors, the atmosfere, it is all there!!!! Even the music is so nice with all the extras!This movie definitely deserves Oscar's,If you are a big Barbie fan you will understand the jokes even better! Especially if you are older than 30. It's fantastic! It is not really a movie for childrens, they will love the dancing and clothes and so but will not understand everything I think.So if you want to have a good laugh! Go see this movie!\", \"A great film that shows both the hardship of real life and the beauty of life. Great film and unexpected .I would highly recommend for any viewer , I felt the corny dancing and the meaningful actions made for a great cocktail.I went with a mixed group of different ages and everyone enjoyed the film. Some found it meaningful and some found it comedic and slapstick.The cast was one hundred percent perfect and I can't imagine a different Ken or Barbie. Ryan gosling played his part superbly and you could at times relate to his character and other times laugh at his mid fortune and dance routines.Overall a great film.\", \"It was funny, gorgeously done and challenged people's view points which is a lot done for a movie made by a toy company. I found myself laughing and tearing up at certain points. I was in awe while watching it in the theaters for the attention to detail on props. It's insane how well made it is.SPOILERS ISH ?? My only critique is the ending for the kens. We sympathise with them throughout the movie and the message is about equal rights for women. But feminism is about equal rights for everyone! Ken's deserve their freedom too. However it definitely did the job of making men step out of their comfort zone and understanding what it's really like to be a woman.\", \"I was really excited to see this movie, and I wanted to enjoy it so badly, but it really didn't live up to the expectations. I should also probably mention that I'm a young adult and female, pretty much the target demographic for this movie. I'm also a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's projects - this one just doesn't hit the mark, sadly.It starts off quite well - the very initial scene is fairly humorous despite us already seeing it in the trailer, but it declines pretty quickly. There's too much repetition throughout the entire thing for starters; the travel montage used to indicate the characters entering Barbieland stops being funny around half way through the second roll, and was rinsed and repeated so many times that I genuinely can't remember how many times I must've watched that scene over and over. I understand the effort that went into making those individual cuts behind-the-scenes, and did appreciate the organic filmmaking that made them up, but it just felt almost too child-like for a film that was clearly pushing to be profound in a more mature context.I came away from the movie none-the-wiser as to the point of the Mattel CEO. Was he supposed to be friend? Foe? Nobody knows. There were no stakes at all involved with Barbie getting caught by Mattel - what would've happened had they put her in the box? And, with this in mind, what kind of world are we dealing with here? We know that Barbieland is readily-accessible to humans, but there was very little effort in explaining any of this to the audience. Whilst it sounds pessimistic to say this about any fantasy movie, it still just felt weird to watch.There were two particular scenes that I found fairly profound and well-done: Ferrara's character's speech and the flashback scene. The music for this movie was brilliant, especially What Was I Made For, with the exception of Lizzo's piece used earlier on which is yet another example of useless repetition (I know that this is the point of the scene, Barbie waking up to have her previously-perceived perfect day ruined, but the song was just downright odd to me and not humorous in the slightest). Ryan Gosling as Ken was, ironically, the best part of the movie for me. His singing was great, his timing absolutely phenomenal, and the dance moves fabulous! The cast in general absolutely smashed it, as did the makeup, wardrobe, and set teams behind the magic of Barbieland. Additionally, the message is very true-to-life and does tackle it well (even if Barbie still has to apologise to Ken in the end when that very much doesn't happen when the roles are reversed in the real world!).Overall, it's okay. I wouldn't say it's good, and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to see it. I don't think the movie was marketed well at all, to that end. Before anyone thinks - and correctly, I might add - that this movie had more marketing than any movie released this year in terms of advertising and numorous brand deals, I'm talking about Gerwig's target demographic. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the movie being unsuitable for their children, and I agree - I was close to leaving around 20 minutes in out of sheer boredom, so god knows how a child would feel - but the marketing makes the target demographic very fuzzy indeed. I know that the movie is about breaking down stereotypes, but most of the children (and, come to think of it, the adults) in my showing did not laugh at a good chunk of the humour because it was so poorly-timed or simply not understandable for a child. The movie is very overrated, and I'm extremely disappointed that it's not what a lot of people were expecting. That being said, if brand appeal and plots made of empty air is your thing, then go for it.\", 'Just amazing and a spectacular film for everyone of all ages. The cast and direction of the film were amazing! The set pieces and art direction was inspired. Additionally, the script was air tight and very funny. I cried and laughed throughout the film. I truly believe the movie will become a classic. The only reason it lost a star was because of some of the loose ends of the plot in the film. Overall the film was a great movie going event and extremely rewarding. I think Gerwig is very good at subverting audience expectations which makes the film more engaging. I would recommend this movie for everyone.', \"Oh my glob! I freakin love this movie like total so much like holy wow!Ken is the bestest character of all times. He's such an inspirational inspiration I can't even come up with words to even like totally explain it and stuff.He was the highlight of the movie by far. I hope they make a Ken movie next time. Ryan Gosling is so amazing in this movie like holy freak! He deserves the Grammy award for this master piece of perfect performances in the Barbie movie like whoa!How is it even possibly real that he was that good in the movie that wasn't even his own thing?! Like oh my globbbbb for really real I'm blown away like wowie wow.\", 'I really liked this film it is a pretty sensitive topic in a land of fun and rainbows I think it got the message through but had just the right amount of humor it also had a lot of great acting g from Ryan gosling and Margot Robbie I really like this film it\\'s great for Adults and for kids even if the topic flies over their heads although I don\\'t think the acting and the screenplay is all flawless I think there are some things they could\\'ve done to make it better for example in one scene when Barbie was in her car driving to the \"real world\" it was really glitch in choppy at least for my theater but I don\\'t think that was intentional.-Great film overall 8.5/10.', \"A popcorn movie I define as a movie that I don't need to take seriously or get to invested I can just sit back with my popcorn and enjoy it and that's exactly what Barbie was for me. I really just enjoyed getting into the barbie world and all it's quirks and joys. If your gonna do a barbie movie I believe this would be the best way to go about it. That being said I think there are some parts that I believe take you out movie a little and I felt at some points the movie struggled with trying to send a message. It was very on the nose and whilst that works at some points it took me out of it on others. Character wise I believe the casting was perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie I couldn't imagine anyone else and Ryan Gosling carried the film comedically. The supporting cast was amazing as-well and everyone played their part perfectly. Overall I would definitely watch this again and it was great joy to turn off my brain and just have fun with it :)\", 'This movie was wonderful. I went in with lowered expectations because I find the majority of big movies don\\'t live up their hype. This was not the case here. Beautiful acting and message without being too pushy. It was very accessible; it didn\\'t pander, and it didn\\'t condescend. The dialogue felt very real and not scripted. SO much fun and tons of funny moments. The only thing I questioned was why the montage at the end didn\\'t include some of the pain and sad moments of human existence. It sort of made Ruth saying \"I can\\'t in good conscience...\" a strange thing to include. I\\'m hoping this will maybe make it into an expanded version?', 'I thought the plot would be very good for what it seemed in the trailer.... but it was very boring with certain funny scenes.... also the ideal would have been for the Kens to be united, to be equal in their world, not to leave them underneath as always and making them look like idiots, which is supposed to be the concept that wanted to be eradicated.... I feel that the performances were very forced except for Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera.....The movie tried to give a good message but it really ended up being very confusing, I expected a comedy more than a movie trying to be existential..............', \"I went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations, -even though I admire Greta Gerwig a lot- but not even fifteen minutes into the movie I was already laughing and crying and hooked. It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected.\", \"Had so much more potential. This script was disastrous and felt like what you see in a disappointing sequel. Although Margot Robbie is a perfect cast and she does her job well, it's not enough to carry this movie alone. Ryan Gosling was the bright positive and main source of entertainment, especially during the first half of the film. Not the worst movie of the year but not the best of it's release week either.Overall feeling is Gerwig tried a little too hard with the story and ended up missing the point. I am still left with questions of objectives by certain story arcs. Ultimately they tried to be a little too deep, muddying the water and losing the crowd along the way.\", 'I am not kidding, the movie was hilarious, self aware, touching, camp, beautiful, it was everything. My friend told me it was rare to hear me laugh so much, next to us was a couple and the bf was also dying from laughter. The \"this movie is not for me\" means that you maybe are close minded, if you go to see anything with prejudice, you will more likely not enjoy it. I think it is fair if it isn\\'t your cup of tea but don\\'t review bomb the movie, there nany famous movies that are not for me but i don\\'t think they are bad. Why can\\'t women, mothers and daughters have something for them? All those 1 star reviews are disgusting. I recommend to put the pinkest thing you own and enjoy the movie, i am glad i watched her.', \"I really wanted to like this. I consider myself a moderately radical feminist and heard great things about this film. The opening scene is fantastic. As a Barbie lover, it was so much fun recognizing outfits, dolls and accessoires I used to have. I quickly realized you need to have a lot of foreknowledge to enjoy the sets and costume design etc.Now, onto the bad: the movie is so boring. None of the plot lines are well developed. All men are presented as stupid or clumsy.Barbies save Barbieland from the Kens, changing everything back to how it was before. The Kens don't even get a house in Barbieland!?I thought Barbie and Ken were going to share the house and become platonic roommates. When one of the Kens asks if they can have 1 supreme court judge, I thought they were going to let Allan be a judge. But no! Just a quip about the Kens only allowed in lower positions?Poor Allan, he was a true ally to the Barbies and he was patronized, ignored and just plain ridiculed. There were so many opportunities for the film to make it about equality and instead they went for a kind of strange revenge plot?Missed chance.The worst part: Ken was the best, most interesting character in a movie about BARBIE.\", \"Went into this movie knowing it'd be hilariously awkward. Robbie as Barbie and Gosling as Ken. Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories. My only hope is that this destroys Mission Impossible at the box office so we can witness Barbie defeating Tom Cruise. Worth a watch and probably a re-watch once it goes up for rent digitally.\", \"The movie started well then missed a perfect chance of a beautiful empathetic ending.I was expecting that once Barbie visited the real world, she would understand how Ken felt in her world. Decide that no superiority should be instigated neither in a sense nor in another, and hence come best with a better plan of equality to show the lead for a better world. Which would have been a perfect message modern women would give.But here we got zero empathy for Ken, rather a plan to manipulate men and empower them back (that's the point?).I'm honestly surprised they get away with such an ending.\", \"While not seeing previous Greta Gerwig's movies might have been a mistake on my side, starting exploring her filmography with Barbie (2023) was surely quite an interesting choice. Honestly, I was a little scared and worried about finally seeing this film - after so much hype on Twitter and other social media it would be disappointing finding out that the movie is not a 10/10 masterpiece. Eventually, I decided that no matter how bad (or good) Barbie actually is, at least I will have the pleasure of seeing Ryan Gosling's astonishing face (and body) on the big screen. The first few scenes of the film absolutely captivated me with their doll-like, plastic pink aesthetic, showing Barbieland as a perfect, colorful paradise. I have to admit though, once our two main characters travelled to the real world, things got a little cheesy. Of course I didn't expect Barbie to be deep or dramatic, but for me it fell into the family toys-come-to-life movie cliche a little bit too much. However, I really liked the comedious aspect of the film, all the references to history of the Barbie doll and others. I might as well say that Barbie became my new comfort movie, something to watch with your best buds, or even a loved one.\", 'While the Barbie movie delivers a range of colorful and diverse visuals, casting, and thematic concepts, it just fell short for me in the way of substance and execution, leaving me wanting more.The physical makeup of the Barbie movie is most definitely a strong suit within the film. The set pieces, environments, and outfits, are all adequately colorful, visually pleasing, and reminiscent of early 90s to 00s Barbie marketing. The colorful cast of both recognizable and lesser known actors creates a diverse character list which is relatively cohesive with the overall plot(s). The character designs feel unique and refreshing while also remaining recognizable throughout. The sets and props feel whimsical and fun while also providing purpose and interesting context. They honestly created \"Barbieland\" perfectly, and are able to include clever visual jokes and references. However it can occasionally feel a little random or \"on the nose\" like they\\'re just waiting for middle aged women in the audience to go \"oh my god! I had that when I was a kid! It\\'s Barbie!\". Marketing genius but it may get old after some time. However. Barbie\\'s plot. This is where Barbie fell short for me. It feels like directors of the movie spent a significant amount of time shoveling money into the visuals and IMMENSE amount of marketing for this movie, and with three months left they scrambled to put together a plot for the cast and set pieces. There are multiple plots strung together very loosely that feel disjointed. Because of this, none of the thematic concepts are explored adequately and it\\'s difficult to feel much of anything for any one of the characters. Character development happens very quickly and anytime we think we\\'re going to receive a more complex character, their facade melts and they are revealed to be a relatively one sided representation of a specific idea or character role. Barbie: the naive stereotypical perfectionist who developed depth after very quickly coming to terms with change.. and her own mortality? Ken: the weak, insecure man reliant on a woman who develops a sigma facade to stick it to the women controlling his life - but in actuality he is wounded from her rejection. The mother: she\\'s a mom. She has a teenage daughter who she has trouble connecting with. Where have I heard this before? The daughter: a one-sided representation of a \"woke\" teenager who\\'s angst is never explored outside of \"she\\'s just a moody teenager\" , despite this, it is still an integral plot line that is never developed. We are never shown the daughter\\'s transition or possible trauma leading to her developing hatred for her extremely caring and loving parents. All of this is CONSTANTLY being shoved down our throats. None of the character development or themes are very subtle, instead opting for explicit mentions of gender roles, patriarchy, fascism, \"political correctness\" and aloof representations of men in power. While these are all great concepts to explore, they are all tackled simultaneously, and thus executed poorly. In an attempt to avoid confusion, I assume?, these concepts are constantly and directly shown to audience members - even with Ken literally learning the definition of a patriarchy in the library and having that be his motivator for the rest of the film. This easily victimizes women and strips male characters of any and all complexity - reducing them to caricaturas lacking any real substance. There were a few times where the cinematography gave the plot a moment of fresh air, adding scenic and thematic complexity, such as when Barbie first looks around in the real world and sees others experiencing human emotion, before accepting the duality of happiness and pain as a part of organic psychology. However these moments are often overshadowed by reverting character arcs or other themes deemed to momentarily be more important. All in all Barbie offers a fun story attempting introspection in multiple parts, but falls short in its execution of those deeper concepts and ideas, instead opting for cinematic multitasking of the highest degree. Many scenes don\\'t make very much sense or contribute to the plot, but it does still offer a nostalgic exploration of childhood, growing up, and humanity. Admittedly it does have a pretty great soundtrack (Billies song may have brought a tear to my eye despite me not caring about Barbies sudden want to become human, but that\\'s because of that falsetto, wow 😻). And Ice Spice and Niki\\'s rendition of Aquas Barbie girl had both me and my boyfriend wanting to buss a move out of the theatre.', 'Acting is good, Margot did an amazing job at portraying Barbie even though Ryan as Ken absolutely stole the show to be honest. Humour wasn\\'t amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times. Plot is slightly messy, not horrible, like I get it but the movie didn\\'t really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects. Another thing that bothered me was the waste of Will Ferrell\\'s character who could have been a better \"villain\" that simply an incapable clown. I still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because it\\'s execution, cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a \"masterpiece\".', \"...and the Barbie movie managed to exceed them. I haven't been this excited to see a movie in a very long time, and after going to see it twice in the theater, I still can't stop thinking about it. The writing was phenomenal, the acting was solid, the sets were fun, and the story was lovely. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me call my mom and invite her to go see it together. It takes a lot for a movie to be able to deliver an important message, be entertaining to many generations of movie watchers, and even make you want to go see it again. I believe everyone involved in the creation of this movie knocked it out of the park!\", 'A good movie with an important message that is delivered in a way that makes it easy to understand and can resonate with alot of people. Hopefully the way they delivered the message leads people to see the issues they depict in the movie.I truly recomend this movie to everyone who likes \"kids\" movies that also has a good message. The way that the Barbie world was created leads the viewer to be sucked into the world of Barbie. Also the references and homages to other movies and also Barbie sets and movies really sets the cake.A bonus point is that all of Kens lines in the movie is comedy gold and made the whole theater giggle a few times.', \"I found this movie quite average, there are some funny jokes but it focuses too much on the patriarch and gender stuff like that. I'm not trying to be sexist by saying that.As I did watch the movie I found it hard watching Margot Robbie in a role that isn't Harley Quinn, especially in the movie suicide squad. I also feel that thousands, possibly millions of young (by young I mean under 10) people thinking this movie would be a nice calm picturing of what a toy the played with through their childhood but there is a lot of rude humour and mentions p£nises and v@g!nas. Even though the movie has its flaws it's still slightly good but very chaotic at times.\", \"As someone who never grew up with dolls, somehow Barbie ended up teaching me the most. The movie was not only fun and enjoyable but full of philosophy and questions of patriarchy and the functioning of present society.In this movie, you don't just sit around or try to explore through different apps but learn, a lot.Greta Gerwig has did it again, with the script and her direction as she gets into the character. It made the film what it was supposed to do, a enjoyment for a child watching, a nostalgia for older generation and for us a place to finally feel seen not for reels, but for fun, knowledge and all the questions. I would recommend watching it with your family and have a Barbie day out of it.Theme: Pink.\", \"Positives:\\nBarbie is an objectively good movie when you consider it's aspects as a film. The set design is amazing in the Barbie world, and this combined with the amazing wardrobe really makes you feel like this world actually could exist. These two things are a real standout for me, and is everything you could hope for from a Barbie movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play an amazing Barbie and Ken. Something I did not expect was how much I liked Michael Cera's performance as Allan. I feel like his performance gave the film as sense of awkward relief which I enjoyed. Although I touch on why I really didn't like the storytelling aspect of Barbie in the negatives section, I do like how the film builds this metaphor between the relationship of Barbie's and Ken's and the relationship of men and women.Negatives:\\nBarbie is movie where you are not allowed to think for yourself. One of my favorite aspects about storytelling is it's ability to communicate a message in disarming ways. The type of movie where you buy into the message either implicitly or explicitly through exposition of the characters struggles. Movies that forgo this buy in from the audience are more or less just preaching an idea rather than trying to convince or demonstrate an idea. This is really where I have problems with the Barbie movie. While the causes pushed for in the movie are noble, they are so inelegant and on the nose it really does feel like you are being talked at through the entire movie. I cannot tell you a single theme, subtext, or message that the movie was trying to convey that wasn't also explicitly conveyed in dialogue between the characters. Consider something like the dialogue between Barbie and Ken after the Barbie's stopped the Ken's from changing the constitution after Ken returned from the human world with his new idea of patriarchy. In this dialogue, is the only way to convey the idea of not defining your self worth based on others and/or your material possessions is by Barbie saying almost exactly that, but in not so few words? Are the characters so superficial that any attempt to demonstrate that point through self reflection and/or actions would just completely fall flat? This is not an isolate incident either, I would challenge anybody to find either a theme, subtext, or any social/political statement that they movie tries to convey that isn't in some dialogue somewhere where it is almost explicitly stated as such. This issue really makes the movie feel shallow and superficial and uninteresting to watch after a certain point.\", \"Pretty simple. Anyone trying hard to explain why this movie would be any less than 8 stars is trying too hard to be a fake internet movie critic. Thoughtful, quirky, funny, fresh.Far from being heavy-handed, the movie successfully entertains while still being obvious in its message.It's amazing that actors who are portraying plastic versions of stereotypes are able to create individualized characters. The characters in the real world are surprisingly more nuanced and realistic than would be expected, especially when juxtaposed against the Barbie World characters. Just enough realism - and over-the-top comedy - in this film to balance the obvious messaging.Watch it, enjoy it, accept that it's a spectacular film.\", \"This movie has great visuals, and the clothes Barbie wears take me back to my childhood especially the barbie house! Unfortunately, this movie reminds me of a Faberge egg so nice on the outside and beautiful to look at, but there isn't much to see on the inside in this case. Such a waste of millions of dollars that went into this film, but yet there is only a nice beginning, and the rest of the movie is just filled with long dialogue, preachy preach lines that go on into tangents, and they make look guys look super dumb in this film which is messed up lol. I think I like the barbie doll and ken batter in toy story haha. By the way this movie is not for little ones! It will go over their heads LOL.\", \"Im a barbie girl in a barbie world. Life is plastic and its fantastic. Really good. Meta. And a fun time with the family. There's a lot more i want to say. Ryan gosling was funny and good and its nice to see asian representation . It's not as funny as i thought it was going to be but it had a lot of meaning. Women empowerement. Greta Gerwig is always a good one and maerogt robbie definitely is perfet for the role of barbie. I cant think of anyone else. I was a little cringing at some people going and wearing pink but overall everyone had a good time and i think familys would enjoy it and its better than oppenheimer.\", \"This movie is about women and how they are suppressed in the real world. The concept is good but the way they portrayed it is straight up boring in the film. Greta gerwig did not live up to her full potential while making this film. The first half of the film was fun and had a bit of humour . Anything after the first half was just a stretch. Anyone going to watch the movie in the theatre I would suggest you guys not go just wait for the ott release. If someone even wants to go ,go for the hype not to expect anything from it . Well only reason I even gave a four star was because i can't imagine anyone else playing the role of barbie and ken( Margot robbie and Ryan Gosling) they were great.\", 'With some of the greatest casting seen in a film (looking at you, Alan), this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch. Maggot Robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism, anxiety and true ennui. She questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out. Ryan Gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery, understanding and empathy. Incredible costumes, sets, choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen. Great Gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion, making us all wonder if the power of Barbie can truly help to heal the real world.', \"Barbie is an amazing film that mixes comedy and emotional moments skilfully. All the performances are perfect, except for Ryan Gosling who was exceptional at playing himself. I will cry if it doesn't win an Oscar, if not for I'm Just Ken it should be for the phenomenal set design. The costume department really worked their socks off as every character feels unique in its style yet cohesive. The writing was very well thought out and barely gives you a second to catch your breath. Now the star of the show Margot Robbie. I could have wrote a whole review just on her performance. Although we all know her as a very talented actress, she was definitely built for this role. Michael Cera made a great comeback with this role, and was mine and many others favourite part of the film. Also shoutout to Rob Brydon as Sugardaddy Ken!\", \"I feel like I have never watched anything like this before. Its so original, witty, entertaining, satiric, while also dealing with some important and serious issues culturally. I would recommend everyone to watch it, and Im so happy that this exist for future generations to come, to grow up with. It hits so many issues spot on, and with so much humor at the same time. I've never seen these feminist issues being taking up, in such a good way and in such a popular big art piece.Ryan is amazing in this, and definitely steals the scenes!The only thing i missed, and why its not a 10 for me (but 9+) is because I would have loved to have seen more real-life struggles, when they are in the real world - or that it just be more real, tough, like what the real world can be, so we understand more why it can be hard to be a women in todays world, like they mention later in the film.But overall, loved it and love that this exists now. Thank you Greta and Margot, and the whole team!\", \"This Barbie movie is a first for me. The first 5 minutes of the film was unexpected and hilarious, where young girls were smashing porcelain dolls into smitherines. Afterwards, when we got introduced to Barbie Land, I was bored. Yes, there were a few quips here and there that were funny, like when the suits in an office building told Ken that he needed a college degree and other inane qualifications to work there, as cover for the patriarchy. The acting was good. Weird Barbie, played by Kate McKinnon, was the most entertaining. The scene where the Kens were battling each other was bizarre and, at the end, I don't understand why Barbie chose to be in the real world, except as a set up for Barbie ll. Barbie's power is in Barbie Land, inspiring girls all over the world for the next millennia. In the end, I didn't care. I bet that young kids expecting this to be a different movie fell asleep too. The friend I was with was even more bored than I was. So what made this movie a first for me? Barbie succeeds on its own terms but... I hated it. That's never happened before. If I hate a movie it's because I think it's a bad movie and I can tell you why it's a bad movie. I can't with Barbie. Maybe I gotta see my gynecologist.\", 'It\\'s true, any other movie would\\'ve been better.I was really looking forward to seeing Barbie! Thought it would be more fun & bring back a lot of childhood memories. I was expecting a light and airy movie.However, the message was disappointing to me. I also found myself looking at the time hoping it would be over soon. They preached that this movie was for \"everyone\" & am so thankful that there weren\\'t any children in the theater when I saw it because I do not think it was appropriate for younger aged kiddos.Will still always love Barbie & Margot Robbie just wish this would\\'ve been better!', \"I was mostly expecting a fun comedy but this turned out to be such a superb meta monster, the likes of which I hadn't seen since original Deadpool movie... And then the cast, script & visuals of Barbie went farther into some insightful, biting & modern thematic territories.Ms Robbie & Mr Gosling shine exceptionally well and play flawlessly together. Hell, all the cast is sublime. I usually dislike Mr Farrell's antics but even they worked perfectly here. This has rightfully become the box-office king of the year (So far at least) and I truly hope it can also shine during the awards season. I know it's hard to include something called freaking Barbie among the end of the year awards / prestige selections but goddammit, this Barbie DESERVES it.\", \"I know this review is like a month late but if you haven't already watched barbie you really should. I thought this would be a fun or child like movie but I ended up crying at the end. I found it very heartwarming, it's genuinely a good movie. In this movie Barbie try's to find her true self while wondering what her worth and purpose is and understand herself. It also has some funny jokes I liked in the movie. I think this movie is an absolute masterpiece, both funny and sad. I would personally rate this movie ten out of ten especially if you're into heartwarming and I guess somewhat relatable. I highly recommend this :).\", 'The film opened with so much potential with great graphics and actual lol jokes on the Barbie world as well as Mattel making fun of itself. The movie even opens up the whole controversy about what Barbie stands for from the very beginning; that Barbie is suppose to be a symbol for girls to feel empowered to do whatever they want to do, but in many ways create the total opposite result. So this setup made me hopeful and expectant of a unique and profound perspective of self-image, patriarchy, parenting, etc.However, it did none of that. It threw in some female characters in real life, gave them no dimensions, tossed in those tiring storylines about sophomoric \"inspiring\" speech that can rescue all. The end to Barbie makes no sense. No wonder everyone found Ken to be the best part of the movie.I would like to think that the creators and writers had a much better original vision that somehow got derailed through the production process. It certainly felt that way.', \"I haven't written a review on IMDb before but I felt like I need to for this film.Genuinely one of the most heartwarming yet emotionally poignant movies I've seen for a very long time, and honestly the first movie I've genuinely felt understood by.It made me laugh it made me cry, I never expected the Barbie movie of all things to stick like it did and strike a chord with me. This is a movie that links directly into my experiences as a woman and perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to be under the societal pressures of being a woman and the impossibilities we face every day. America Ferrera's monologue was incredible.Honestly, I'd recommend this film to anyone and feel like it's crucial that it gets the recognition it deserves. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal director and I can't wait for her next project.\", \"I can be honest and say as a child I didn't love Barbie's but that doesn't mean I wasn't excited to see this film. It was nostalgic in terms of costumes and the set but I just didn't really understand the flow of the movie. Plus the underlying message of equality was beaten to death and honestly kinda had the opposite effect.Start of SPOILERSThe movie starts out with a funny skit on how Barbie was created/imagined. It then flows into how Barbie is perfect in every way and everyday is the same in Barbie land. Things then seem to change when the standard Barbie starts thinking about death which idk seems a little harsh for a child's toy. Like maybe an existential crisis of some sort would have been less triggering. Then the movie moves into leaving Barbie land for the real world to make Barbie happy again but it pretty much does the exact opposite. While Barbie is gone the Ken's take over and change all the Barbie things about Barbie Land. Once Barbie returns she recruits all the other Barbies they take back Barbie land.End of SPOILERSNow from a readers perspective I'm sure it's very easy to follow that summary but in the actual movie there's a lot more in between moments that just didn't really belong in the movie. And to be honest a lot of the unnecessary stuff was basically advertisement for Chevy and other brands.All in all this movie had some funny moments but was mostly a disappointment for me and I honestly regret even taking the time to see it.\", 'It definitely lived up to my expectations. Walking into the theater I was scared. Considering all the amazing marketing and promotion for this movie, it could\\'ve been easily disappointing, but it wasn\\'t for me. The acting was amazing, the jokes and dialogue were funny, but most importantly, it had a message and they stick to it throughout the movie. I don\\'t think the world is ready for a film centered around women, maybe it\\'s too soon. I think some men will wrongly assume that it is an \"anti-men\" movie and they will hate it for it. It\\'s far from that. My hope is that, with time, people will understand its message and realize that we\\'re all Kenough.', \"I was really looking forward this movie and my expectations were quite high actually so I was a bit scared to be disappointed but that wasn't the case at all. The movie is so funny, cute and smart at the same time, Meg does a wonderful job portraying Barbie's character, she was the perfect cast for the part. Ken was also really funny, plus the relationship of a mother and daughter was a really nice touch.I sincerely hope more man can see this movie so maybe they can understand a little bit more how difficult it is to be a woman in this modern world and can be a bit more kind towards the woman's in their lives.Highly recommended. Definitely a new favorite.\", 'I loved this movie. The acting was phenomenal, story line and dialogue were great, the sets and costumes were just *chefs kiss*. I took my mom, who is 70, and loved watching her turn into a little girl again. She kept saying \"I remember that Barbie!\" regarding Midge and Allen. I can see why guys don\\'t enjoy it as much, but the point is, this movie is for women, by women, and very much enjoyed by women. The message is for all though, and I\\'m sad some people don\\'t get it. Little girls can go and be enthralled with all the colors. There\\'s nothing too overt for them to see. Mostly the movie will go over their heads.', \"I would like to start by saying that Ryan Gosling delivers an impressive performance as Ken, truly standing out in the film with his remarkable portrayal. However, the movie doesn't quite meet the marketed expectations, opting for a more adult, satirical, and meta-commentary approach instead of the anticipated lighthearted comedy, which may make it less enjoyable for some who were expecting different things . The visuals and humor can be excessive at times, possibly detracting from the overall experience. Additionally, the movie's direct handling of its message , while thought-provoking, might polarize viewers.\", \"I enjoy the time watching this, because the details are there and represent a lot the experience we all live in our time. Besides the work of ryan and margot in this movie conveys a higher level of feeling, a feeling you can't describe, you feel the conection between them and you. It really argues about feelings and social deconstruction, and in the work doesn't show a treat any of the genders superior to others, in reality there is a dependency between genders that is easily evidenced, talks about the importance of knowing how to value oneself as a person and it is evidenced in the relationship between Barbie (Margot) and Ken (Ryan), in which Ken has a dependency on Barbie in which he cannot exist without her, which is reflected in our society.\", \"This movie makes us think, what kind of story would create the direct interaction between Barbie and human beings? So unique, and I could not guess where we were going. The graphic is cheerful with the value of feminism and patriarchy, a spirit of self-identity, and about passion. I don't think children should watch this; some jokes were sarcastic yet funny for those who understand it. Children might find this movie exciting but maybe find difficulties in some parts of it.I still can say it is worth watching, but I didn't find extraordinary things in it. As a fan of Barbie, I still like the movie. But yeah, I don't think I would like to rewatch it again. I love the actors and actresses, they were amazing.\", \"I went in to this movie expecting a huge joke of a movie and came out with a smile on my face and a warm heart. So many things resonated with me, from the weird Barbie that I inherited from my older sister, to never really understanding where Ken lived or why he never went to work. Margot Robbie was the perfect Barbie. America Ferrera did a brilliant job of being a normal woman trying to explain how to be the 'perfect' woman to Barbie. Ryan Gosling STOLE THE MOVIE! His Ken was so insanely good and the 'I am just Ken' song and dance routine was insanely good! Thank you Greta Gerwig for writing this movie!\", 'I thought the movie was fantastic, fun and a good time with a good message. The acting was great, the music, the colors, the cinematography, story. All \"A\" grade. Only 2 things really coulda been better and even with that I still highly recommend the movie!2 things that could be better include first putting less silliness and more useful messaging around the corporate heads. Though this could also have saved the movie from getting too deep for some, it could have been excited fun but more impactful.Second, if the ending wasn\\'t just her going in the real world. I wish Barbie had a stronger ending as a character, a much more eloquent speech on what\\'s wrong and even highlight the issues we had in the real world trying to fix patriarchy. Think it would be stronger if Barbie stayed in Barbie world and fixed it and then if they wanted to set up for a possible second film she is visited in consult.', \"If ur over 13 this movie will most definitely bore you. The movie tried so hard to make a point yet still failed.The cast was amazing but the plot didn't do much\\nI see how the writers tried to make the movie show us the double standards when it comes to woman rights but honestly they did such a bad job at that. I really hoped this movie would actually be as meaningful as the writers intended it to be but it was just a very bad comedy.a very bad representation of woman and just overall a bad movie.It could be fun for passing time and for girls night, but don't expect to be amazed by it.cause you will be disappointed.\", \"I am neither a Barbie lover nor hater but I am a fan of great sets and creative films so I was prepared to put up with a bad story line to see the visuals but I LOVED it! So, so funny, Ryan Gosling was amazing as was everyone really. Haven't laughed so consistently in a film for ages. The end was slightly weaker so I've knocked off a point but regardless it's one of the best films I've seen in ages. The sets were amazing as I had hoped. I could have lived without the Will Ferrel character as it felt a little bit spoofy whenever he was on screen, a bit overacted but that's just a minor criticism in a brilliant movie. Well done team!\", \"The only reason this movie even gets a 2 from me is because Margot Robbie is a beautiful woman. It's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. A waste of money to see. Will Ferrell plays his usual ridiculous self as all of his roles. Ryan Gosling also has a role that is beneath him. Margot Robbie is a great actress and so much more capable than this role. A definite don't see this movie. It should have an age rating no one over the age of eight years old allowed unless accompanied by a toddler. Yes, it was that bad. An embarrassment to all who acted in this movie. The writers should be ashamed. This may be all that Hollywood is capable of during a writers strike. Hopefully there will not be a sequel to this God awful movie. I only saw it because my wife wanted to see it for some strange reason. I would have to say it's the worst movie I have ever paid to see hands down. So not waste your time or your money to go to this movie. Wait for it to go to video. It shouldn't take long.\", \"This movie moved me deeply. I am a 20-year-old girl and to finally see a movie that deals with gender inequality and patriarchy in such an intelligent way was something I really did not expect. Very satisfied. Hearing and seeing an acknowledgement of our current situation as a society was absolutely necessary. During several scenes of the film I literally had tears in my eyes because I finally felt understood. The message in my opinion is clearly expressed. It is up to the viewer to perceive it. Anyone who thinks that the ending expresses the superiority of barbies over ken is missing the point, they are completely off the mark. Not only women's issues are shown in the movie, but also men's issues. I highly recommend viewing also for men, without prejudice and with the will to understand. Nothing more to add, a masterpiece that deals with very topical social issues that we needed. Thank you Barbie.\", 'Wife forced me to see it with her. I had my doubts naturally, and really, a plastic toy movie for girls? I wouldnt watch He man either. I came in with very low expectations and came out thinking this was the best movie of the year thus far(havent seen Oppenheimer yet).Just a fantastic fun movie with a great soundtrack and honestly great moral story. This is dispite thinking what the Kens did to the Barbies was completely fair and not unprovoced with the end game of the movie being a bit puzzling as everything went back to the same as before with no lesson learned?I have 27 characters left to fill..Great movie though, worth a watch.', 'I have seen a better movie than I expected. The cast was really good and also the dialogue helps a lot. There was not anything ridiculous, as I expected, and the actors did the best work in order to create a mix between comedy and drama. The story is ready to shock you and the lines are both funny and touching. The movie made me think about How Grinch stole the Christmas and The Truman Show.Again, Ryan Gosling show us that he is a master of musical and this time he is something like the bad guy.Margit Robbie was exceptional from beginning to the end.All the other actors did a great job.I really recommend this movie!', \"The film goes around feminism and such. Its message is quite good and I agree with it. But the movie itself is the worst movie I have ever seen. Its made for like 2 years olds but with expressions that only adults van understand. It was painful to sit through the two hours play time because nothing really happened and every caracter was annoying. Not just annoying but also very simple. It seemed like noone had any brain. They are talking to everyone like you would talk to a two year old.There isnt really a plot to follow, just two straight hours of whining and nerve-wracking dialoges.For the love of god don't watch this movie. It takes away two hours of you life.After the movie everyone I could hear (including girls) was saying that this was waaaaay worse than anyone expected. So please spare yourself.\", \"A story that explores Mattel that manufactured the barbie dolls Margot and Ryan Gosling steal the show and are phenomenal in this as well as the supporting cast having a satisfying amount of screen time which gives everyone a moment to shine the soundtrack is great and really adds to the world of barbie highlights was Will Ferrel he also shined in this and made some great moments as well as Alan played by Michael Cera who I haven't seen in anything for ages and it was good to see them again greta gerwig did an amazing job with this movie and hit out the summer blockbuster of the year with this I give this a solid 8.5/10.\", 'I was very excited for this movie and I dont go to the cinema very often.The first half was kind of funny to watch. But then came Will Ferrell and I cant stand this sort of humor. In my opinion, you cant mix such dumb humor with wich was attempted a great story and message. Margot Robbie was great though. I wish the other Ken and Barbie Characters got more screentime.Maybe I try the OV once again, because I watched the German version. Because I cant believe, this movie disappointed me so much. 😅And its definetely not a kids movie. We had many teens and kids in our theatre and they all found it boring.', \"We can be surprised at the bold feminist narrative of this film, which turned out to be a larger portion of the movie that most anticipated, but we should all learn from it. How urgent is an appreciation for women and their leadership if it takes a movie about literal toys in a fantasyland to see a female president? Barbie shows us what society would look like if women occupied ALL of the roles currently held by men, which quickly illustrates the alarming lack of representation. Barbie points out the irony in laughing an all-female Supreme Court, when the United States Supreme Court (for example) was all-male for its first 191 years. Barbie's achievements extend to business leadership, Nobel Prizes, and space travel.The film breaks down feminism for all ages and gender identities, taking female empowerment to levels so basic that young children will immediately recognizes real inequalities in our world. Gerwig and the wonderful cast explore feminism through mother-daughter relationships, the workplace, and even generational differences through a touching portrayal of Barbie's founder, Ruth Handler.A host of LGBTQ+ characters add to the strong community atmosphere of this film, in addition to physically disabled characters and other marginalized Barbies who effectively teach inclusion as a benchmark and not an ideal. The film wastes no time pandering to those who take issue with the narrative and by doing so, encourages women to unapologetically take up space.Mattel's willingness to confront the unrealistic body expectations and problematic pieces of Barbie's history head-on seriously validates the message of this film and the importance of doing better because you know better. Cheers for Barbie!\", \"As a teenager I kinda just went to this movie because of all the hype and jokes on Instagram, TikTok etc. But surprisingly this movie was actually really good. Unsurprisingly Margot Robbie was phenomenal, and was the PERFECT choice for Barbie.When the movie first started I really didn't know what it was going to be, I thought it would just be a girly movie about dolls and feminists, and everything wrong with Hollywood nowadays, but this quickly proved otherwise. It had the perfect amount of jokes, (which were surprisingly funny) the plot was simple but entertaining . Toward the end of the movie it got really serious, and it really had me thinking about life in a way where I just want to get my life together and be a better person. In conclusion this movie was great and Greta Gerwig did an amazing job with the cast and the movie as a whole!!!\", \"Barbie is fun, hilarious, emotional, musical, thought provoking, full of fantasy, sometimes over the top. It transfers us to whole new magical world and you will enjoy every single second of it while makes us relate to ourselves and our real world problems, emotions and situations. Filled with powerful performances and soundtracks. A instant classy, Must Watch. Margot Robbie owns the role Barbie. She lives the character. Ryan as Ken is so great. He does really steals the show sometimes. All the others supporting characters and human characters are so good and fun too.Barbie movie really respects it's roots and pays a beautiful tribute to all Barbie dolls and it's creators.\", 'I recently watched this movie with my daughter. I expected a nice movie but the story is lousy and I thought it was not funny. I think the movie should be fine for my niece of 9 years old but for me I did not understand what the fuss was about. It was predictable, bad story. The begin started simple and when whe went to the real world there was so much more that could have been done but instead the story if very simple and no depth. Well maybe I am just to old for it haha.I am sure there will be a barbie 2 and 3 as long as they make money from it. Even my 17 year old daughter did not like it and thought it was a childrens movie.', \"About reality. None of the nonsense of ask the Barbie Movies. In all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human. It was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys. It would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained. Very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understand.I told my human it was pretty much Rocky Horror Picture Show without the sexuality and way more pink. Not really a movie to take serious but lighthearted and just a goofy movie to enjoy on some down time. If it wasn't so new then i would do an Episode on my podcast about it.\", \"Barbie movie had superb casting, writing, acting, and plot twists. It was a surprisingly cerebral movie with a poignant message on the perils of patriarchy in the real world and the exclusion of men in the Barbie land. At its heart, Barbie is a movie about self-discovery. The movie is much more insightful than I expected and takes a deep dive into the perils of minimizing the humanity of women and men be it in Barbie Land or the real world.Barbie Movie has some plot twists and it challenges stereotypes and preconceived notions of the roles of men and women in society. Barbie doesn't want to be put in a box in the real world and Ken wants to have value and a meaningfully existence in Barbie Land.\", \"I tried getting tickets for this movie for 3 days, and it was all sold out. But we didn't give up. The sun rose, and determination made me do the longest line at 2pm for a showtime at 9pm. Watching a movie in a third world country while on vacation is hard.Back to the main point, I cried. Don't watch this movie with your mom, because you will sob and try your hardest not to make a sound in a silent room.This movie captures girlhood in such a unique way, not a lot of people will get it. Barbie was my childhood-so when I sat down in the movie theater, it wasn't eighteen year old me that watched it, but little 4-13 year old me. It was such a beautiful experience; dressing up and being a girl. It made me really happy and I fully enjoyed it.\", \"For a girl who grew up playing with Barbies wasn't at all what I thought it would be. I didn't think there would be a huge plot, and I was so wrong! The movie should be what every woman needs to see. Everyone in it was amazing and perfect (not Barbie perfect 😉). Had an amazing plot that made me really consider how far women have not come in life. I do love the line when a man has to ask for a job in the government and gets told he can have a much lesser job. I can not give it enough accolades. Everyone cast was perfect for their role. America Ferrera and Margot Robbie were perfection for each role!!!!Will watch again and again!\", \"Over all its very low movie i ever never see it boring to much until you think the climate change it's very real and the world go wrong because some bad low quality movie producer and companies that they know how get scores in some platforms and earning cash just because they know to do that and they don't care about making great movies and making life better like the Barbie movie says 😭 its better to the movies producer and the companies belongs this business invest and invent knew technologies that makes revolutionary movement to protect this business for long term and not just earning cashs by bringing Margot Robbie and others and making them as showing model's....... very bad movie 😔😔😔😔\", \"I found this movie one of the more entertaining movies I have seen in some time. I didn't know what to expect and started out thinking when we were in Barbie Land how are they going to make this interesting for the next hour and 1/2. I found out and was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns I didn't expect. When Barbie ends up in the 'real world' it goes from entertaining to interesting and unexpected. Margo is perfect as Barbie, Ryan as Ken is over the top and to be enjoyed. What I haven't read and am a little disappointed by is the failure to recognize how good America Ferrerra and Ariana Greenblatt were. Totally enjoyed their screen time as well. Don't event get me started on Kate McKinnon as 'weird' Barbie. I was one of those children that actually melted Barbie's hair in my bedroom closet and equally defaced and marked her with indelible markers. Didn't mean I didn't love her, was just precocious.\", \"Too many sexual references and doesn't grasp the concept of barbie. The production and crew could have done a lot more with this movie to draw more attention. Like again I said in the title waste of time. With also not adding enough in the movie they have also tried too much on the set and dressing designs, but the cast for the movie was okay with me but instead of Ryan gosling as Ken Freddy Prinze Jr. Instead. With this movie I feel sad that production made this movie PG-13. Because the age group of people that lobve barbie are 5-9 year Olds. But parents can take their children to see babies but kids will not find it exciting with all of the adult jokes and references.\", \"Barbie (2023):Barbie (2023) is a clever political comedy, instilled with scenes of artfully-employed and often-touching drama, and rife with thinly, albeit comedically veiled commentaries on the woes and whims of patriarchal society, neo-feminism, republicanism, and, surprisingly given the film's main overarching themes, democrat beliefs. At a runtime of 1h 54m, the film was fantastic; I thoroughly enjoyed my viewing, particularly due to the performances of one of the strongest casts I've seen in any film released this year, with Robbie (as Barbie), Gosling (as 'beach' Ken), Ferrel (my favourite performance of the movie, as the Mattel CEO), Mckinnon (as 'weird' Barbie), and Cera (as Alan), amongst others, serving the film's witty, multi-faceted writing well. Each person felt perfect for their role, and I don't personally think it could have been cast any better. It was perfect.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT.The story is simple, but well executed and easily palatable for a range of ages, largely in thanks to the near-scintillating writing of Gerwig and Baumbach, and the clever concealment of political messages, such that they either: fit in well with the story and serve pivotally to the plot (Ken introducing the patriarchy to the other Kens in Barbie Land, or, as it becomes, Kendom), or, are placed into a scene in which they cause no hindrance or clunkiness and simply convey a message (Ferrel's character, much like his President Business in the Lego Movie, wears an outfit analogous to that of Donald Trump, and Ken's whole newly-instated patriarchy is certainly designed to mimic many republican beliefs, along with perpetuating stereotypes like gorging on beers by day and engaging in superficial traditionalisms (horses!)). The comedy is, by all accounts, really funny. Multiple gags persist throughout, like the discontinuation of 'Pregnant Barbie', the lack of genitalia on Barbies and Kens, Weird Barbie (Mckinnon), and the callowness of the Mattel executives. There are great one-off jokes too, and many are clearly intended to cater towards adults, as well as children, like when Barbie sees a billboard for the 'Miss Universe' beauty pageant on the Venice Boardwalk, coming to the conclusion that they must be the Supreme Court (most political entities are conventionally attractive females in Barbie Land), 'depressed Barbie', along with other Barbies playing off body-image stereotypes, and a surprising innuendo spoken by Ferrel's character, in which, with no real context, he refers to the Mattel HQ as a 'long, phallic building'. Overall, the film is very funny, and knows when to, and when not to employ comedy in a scene for the best effect.The pacing is tight for the first half, and it manages to maintain good overall pace throughout, slowing slightly towards the end but still moving along nicely up until the credits roll.Now, the characters. I can't lie, there is not a lot to say, and that's not a bad thing. Each performance is marvellous, thanks largely in part to great casting, but for me, the characters didn't evolve all that much over the film's runtime. Sure, Barbie ends up a human (and gains genitalia somehow, implied by the final scene(?)), Ken becomes slightly more self-aware I guess, the Mattel execs just sort-of sway freely between Barbie-perpetuated matriarchy-proponents, and self-absorbed, blatant sexists, and Weird Barbie becomes de-ostracized, but apart from that, the rest serve as vessels for the film's message, simple and entertaining, but devoid of complexity. One character, Alan (played by Cera), did catch my attention, though I'll talk about him more in my criticisms down below. Another great thing I noticed was the movie's drama. I was actually surprised prior to watching, when I read, via Google, that its genres were Comedy/Drama, and upon watching, was pleasantly surprised. The film includes a few rather touching scenes, satisfying enough not to dull the tone, but serious enough to have impact on the viewer, and aren't plagued by cringy music, nor excessive jokes. They are raw, by all accounts. One such scene features Barbie sat on a public bench, shortly after realising that the world is not a matriarchal 'haven' like Barbie Land. As she cries (in a cowgirl-outfit, no-less), she notices an older woman sat across from her, and tearily declares her 'beautiful', playing on the film's themes of existence, ageing, and impending mortality. It serves as the heart of the movie, and was on-par with something one may expect to find in a more serious drama. Another includes Barbie's meeting with Ruth Handler's ghost(?) in the Mattel head-office, which is later complimented by another, which is laden with innocuous jokes about Ruth's tax-evasion scandals, and holds a more comedic tone.Now, earlier, I praised the film's use of veiled political undertones, but I also believe there were some that didn't quite work. Firstly, I am not sure what message the film was actually pedalling. It certainly wasn't feminism, as many seem to think. Sure, many scenes involve strong women, demonized men (we don't all catcall, sexually harass, or otherwise dominate women in our daily lives), and a somewhat functional matriarchy (only functional for the women), but the film also seems pretty critical of neo-feminist beliefs and ideals. It quite blatantly criticises the matriarchy, in that all of the men are oppressed and exist only to fawn over the women who don't want them, and shows that nonconventional Barbies (Weird Barbie) are ostracized and bullied for deformities which they can't help. Though, it also criticises the patriarchy, in that, nearly every man in the movie sexually objectifies women (to the degree of fetishising them by putting them in skimpy maid outfits), the women that support the patriarchy are all 'brainwashed', and must be 'reprogrammed' in order to have them rebel, and that the patriarchs are all somewhat stupid, or callow. What was the aim?Elsewise, the republicans are certainly minced throughout. Donald Trump symbology, criticism of traditionalist ideals, and the emphasis on cast-diversity certainly sees to this (the cast has multiple black people, latin-americans, and a lesbian, in Kate Mckinnon, amongst other represented minorities). Though, the character I mentioned earlier, Alan, seems to criticise those who are democrats (Left-wing works), in that he is ostracized by the Kens, largely ignored by the Barbies, and seeks to escape, stating that no-one will care if an Alan gets into the real world. He is one of those 'no other character likes them' characters, and overall, manages to throw the film's message into disarray. There is no steadfast, discernable message as far as I can see, and all agendae are both furthered and criticised, with none that stick. As in the end, Barbie Land is still ruled matriarchally, and the Kens are still held in lower esteem by the Barbies, though, the real world is unchanged, and Mattel shows no signs of incorporating female leadership. Furthermore, the Kens never seem to gain any purpose, which was their whole goal. As far as I can tell, they get no dreamhouses, no equality, no horses, no jobs, and no love (</3). This didn't ruin the film for me, by any means, and I still herald it as the best one I've watched this year so far (I am to watch Oppenheimer soon), but it does make me wonder what Gerwig and Baumbach really had in mind.Overall, the film was great, and I would recommend it for all, as long as they can take a joke, don't hate women, don't hate men, and aren't perturbed by politics. It is witty, fun, touching, and hilarious, sated with fantastic performances and easily palatable characters. I give this film an 8/10, and will definitely watch it again.\", \"Barbie was so fun! I think some scenes were a bit hard to follow but I think that's a fun play on how girls play with dolls. I laughed a lot and felt a bit moved and touched. I wasn't really sure what to expect but it was fun to watch all the way through! I loved all of the vintage Barbie pieces and references to the many versions of the doll as well. The scenery was amazing, I think Barbie land gave off a technicolor vibe which was amazing. The scene I loved the most was when Barbie comments on how beautiful the old lady was and the older woman says she knows it! It's a fun film for women of all ages, my grandmother, mother, sisters and friends could all relate to this film! A true masterpiece on girlhood and womanhood.\", \"I really enjoyed this movie and its message. I wish the underlying meaning to the story was a little more subtle, but it was good nonetheless.The soundtrack/songs were one of my favorite things about the film, and they fit really well into scenes. As someone who doesn't enjoy musical numbers in a movie that much, I like these a lot, because they were actually good songs.One of the final scenes of the movie, where Barbie and Ruth were standing together talking about being human was so pretty and well done. It actually got me a little emotional, which I didn't expect.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling really did their jobs well, along with others like Micheal Cera. Overall, the movie was pretty great, and the acting was fantastic.\", '***SPOILERS**Took my girls (7,10,13)to see this last night and they all loved it (bright colours, songs, some comedy) as they didnt understand fully the political message. They make it clearly obvious in the beginning of the movie that all the kens are irrelevant in their matriarchal society, there just to accompany the barbies, so much so that they make this fact into a joke, some things happen, a patriarchal society ensues, the barbies now don\\'t like being in the Kens old position and are shown now as being oppressed (which is now no longer funny) and change it back to a matriarchal society, where the Kens are again walked over (see them not allowed a single ken on the supreme court). They had the chance to send a clear message to the viewers that men and women could be equal and everyone gets a fair shot, but instead used the pettiness of \"women had to endure this so now men should\" approach and I did not like that message for my daughters who I teach they can do anything they put their mind to. Someone needs to teach them that we\\'re not in the 50s no more.On a better note- the cinematography is brilliant, Margot Robbie works well with the material she has, Ryan Gosling is brilliant as usual, Will Ferral is typically Will Ferral, there\\'s some really funny bits in there too, but don\\'t see this movie if you want a funny escape. It\\'s feminist propaganda.', \"This is my first review at imdb and tbh I really wanted to love this movie I did. But it just didn't work for me. It was a movie, it had Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in it but it was nothing groundbreaking. Rather, some metaphors were made that didn't land, Some social commentary was mixed which while I totally get it but It just didn't deliver. The plot had loose ends and loopholes. I also couldn't connect with Margot despite her being the leading role. It just was a disappointment. Especially after all the publicity and riot that this movie is on social media. You can watch the movie. It's watchable but thats all that I can say about it.\", \"I expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones. It ended up being insanely funny, ridiculous, fun, and stupidly entertaining, yet highly topical and commentative. This movie hit on so many topics, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, even misandry, yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout. It never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavy-handed, and I can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message. Other than that, this is the best movie I've seen in years and I can't see any topping it any time soon.\", 'I love that this movie is as others put it \"preachy\". I feel that with the current climate and so many young ladies losing freedoms and not realizing how far women have come in the past 60 years we need reminding how quickly it can all go away, lest young ladies today get too comfortable.There is a lot in this movie about mother/daughter relationships, women\\'s roles in society and how hard it is to be a woman in a society that expects perfection. It is also fun, some great jokes, and Rhea Pearlman really made such a wonderful appearance. When Barbie first came out, it was a time when women didn\\'t have as many options as they do now, women couldn\\'t even have credit! I feel like this movie is a nod to what Barbie is supposed to stand for but also for the ways Barbie has fallen short.', 'I\\'m NOT a Barbie girl in NOT the Barbie World, Life in plastic, It\\'s NOT fantastic. In the beginning of the film, it can be thought that will go nice way with a good end and a powerful message. There is so much effort in the beginning, like building a strong idea, however this is disappered in the final. And this is such a disappointment that the film does nothing about giving an idea about liberal feminism because there is always managers as boys or girls. I think the film\\'s main idea should be every human being no matter it is a boy or a girl can be everything they want and can be handle every situation as a human. It is ridiculous to discuss this as \"being a man or a woman\" in the 2023. In the Barbie world or in the real world it should be out of date. The final should be reviewed with this manner cause the expactation was very high with this huge-budget film...', \"Every moment throught this movie was amazing. From the choreography, to the scenes, to the cast and the costumes and everything in the entire movie, really. The message in this movie made me ball out crying and i still am. It taught me that i don't have to be perfect, or pretty, or always having everything under control. I can be a little bit clumsy at times, or i can cry, or have a bad hair day. It doesn't matter. As long as i'm happy and comfortable in my own skin it's fine. Barbie isn't just barbie. No, she's barbara millicent roberts, she's barbara hangler. She's a pilot, a dancer, a doctor, a teacher, the president. She's anything she wants to be and so can you.\", \"The movie is mediocre at best. I expected an original funny thought provoking film, I got a funny run of the mill movie. I think had I come in with lower expectations it could have been better. Not saying the movie is bad, but throughout the movie it felt like I was listening to music without the bass. I know it's weird but that's literally how it felt. The social commentary was good, but felt a little forced sometimes. I expected the movie to be another Lego Movie where the tules are completely altered, however, you'll find that it follows the same plot arch as well as direction as any other movie, but with a flair of barbie. The visuals could have been incredible based on the world they are in, and in some scenes they were really hood, but most of it is just like any other movie but with beautiful colourful sets. Overall it was really disappointing.\", \"This thought-provoking movie is definitely not geared towards children or exclusively for girls; it's a must-watch for audiences of all backgrounds. It addresses delicate and fragile topics with precision. It was surprising and totally unexpected. Admittedly, the first half an hour is hard to get through, but you really get into it once you get the idea and you're totally consumed in it and already questioning yourself and the society before you realise. However, they could have concluded it better by finding a middle ground or presenting a solution to the problems addressed. Nevertheless, its overall impact makes it a must-see for everyone.\", \"Yes it was a bit preachy at times (the feminist speech that the mom/America Ferrera gave in the middle of the movie was out of place) but overall the message was ok and the movie was cute. I had some doubts about casting but Ryan Gosling killed it and Margot Robbie is obviously the closest to a real life Barbie you could get in the modern day.I'm not really sure the target age demographic either. I'm 17 and saw it with my mom and we both liked it, but idk it might not be great for super little kids. It's not overly vulgar or anything but at times it seems more focused on appealing to teenage girls and grown women.Also, Michael Cera is rad and probably the best part of the movie for me. His role is super fitting and it's fun to see him dressed all in pastel and pink, being a relatively normal dude in scenes full of Barbies.\", \"Gets you a typical Hollywood movie which feels good to watch but provokes you to think it helps you decide whether you want to be just influenced by the world around you the media the news and the industry which is grabbing your attention or do you want to accept that you are a human being with needs and wants and not just a piece of toy to be manipulated by the media.It begins with a simile of everybody's life that is Barbie land it is kind of our own sweet world which every human being prefers to live into rather than entering into the race of humans into the workforce and do the society etc and their Barbie and can reflect upon how different the real world can be from the world they're used to kind of like what happens to people of every kind I think this is a super movie too provoking people to think are they living to please the world around them or are they just living to live.\", \"Some things were super clever and made me laugh. Ryan Gosling's Ken was awesome..he was the best part. There were definitely elements I appreciated and I thought were thought provoking; however, it just felt so political and so forced. It was a huge social commentary which I think can be great but it wasn't seamlessly blended it, it was kinda obnoxious and redundant. Plot was sometimes boring and the storyline about real world meets fake world felt a little bit cliche! Certain moments were just too corny. Did I laugh though? Definitely. It had its moments. I agree with the High Highs and Low lows statements.\", \"At first. I had no interests in watching this movie. But my friends dragged me along. I do not regret using 1 hour and 54 minutes of my life on this movieSpoileralertThe filmmakers are luring us in with great actors and comedy. And then we get the real message hidden behind all that. Barbies world is gender opposite from the real world. Here are all barbies winners, leaders and the important. They are main characters in life and in the movie. In the real world it's mostly men instead. The Ken's (men) are presented as stupid, sexy, and not so important characters. Just they way women mostly are presented as in the most movies. As in the real world. When women realize how the difference in gender views affect their life. They take action. The Ken's does that in movie too. The Ken's went overboard and did not hesitate to downgrade the barbies to sexy women who only can grab a beer for them and even took their homes, positions and jobs. The barbie movie are really about genders, and showing us a world where the gender roles and vision are completely switched. The Ken's are the women of real world.I think barbie is an legendary movie who really shows how many women experience the world. And as every comedy it is a hidden message there. But in barbie it is much stronger. So for some people who don't enjoy lessons. The movie is might not for you. But for thoose who are open minded and enjoy something new. This is the movie for you.The only thing I did not enjoy about the movie is that the leaders in the board of barbie organization was made way too stupid. It would actually be better if they were in normal intelligence state. Ofc with normal intelligence they would still try to make barbie go in the box, and not think too much about Ken on the loose.\", \"For sure It failed to achieve feminism or be a criticism to patriarchy. But what to expect from Barbie and Mattel? Unfortunately, in my opinion the movie did the exact opposite thing. Setting the standards and the stereotypes for women in a non realistic level. Although Margot Robbie was delightful to watch (very classy and beautiful, perfectly representing Barbie) the general movie vibe could be a lot more fun so as to have a meaning watching it. It should last 30 minutes less in duration, and doesn't worth the hype. I am glad I saw it so as to have an opinion but it is nothing more that a typical light meaningless movie.\", 'The discussion surrounding the Barbie movie has generated varying viewpoints, with some reviewers suggesting that the film is critical of men, portraying them as weak and insecure. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the movie offers a sophisticated commentary on broader societal dynamics, encompassing power dynamics, oppression, and gender roles.To begin with, the movie underscores that patriarchy, as a structural framework, doesn\\'t uniformly favour all men. This is exemplified by Ken, whose lack of opportunities becomes apparent in the context of the real world. Contrary to the idea that patriarchy inherently benefits all men, the film sheds light on how this system works to elevates those who already have wealth and authority within society. In essence, it unveils that a genuine world where patriarchy benefits all men, albeit an unlikely scenario, could only exist in a world where conventional rules and responsibilities don\\'t exist (Barbieland), while simultaneously presenting us with an already failing matriarchy that oppresses men.A key theme that emerges is the portrayal of oppression as a learned behaviour. Ken\\'s exploration into patriarchy serves as a catalyst for his evolution. The display of toxic masculinity he develops is rooted in the adoption of traits he observes in an attempt to gain respect and power. It becomes clear, however, that this façade doesn\\'t genuinely resonate with him as a person. In the final moments of the movie, Ken rejects the ideas and behaviours he initially believed to be powerful, realising that they neither align with who he is as a person or make him feel fulfilled. This underscores how societal expectations often make men feel pressured into conforming to behaviours within a system that, in reality, fails to serve their genuine interests.There is a clear narrative in the last 20 minutes of the movie to show that most men, while being aware of patriarchy, aren\\'t actively trying to oppress women, which is really clear when Ken says he thought it was just about riding horses. This highlights how many men, while aware of patriarchy, don\\'t actively try to oppress women. Instead, sticking to the status quo comes from a fear of challenging the existing power structures out of fear of losing power or falling into the same state of oppression they were forcing on women.Ultimately, the core message of the movie is to advocate for an equitable world that doesn\\'t support the dominance of men or women. The film suggests that power does not need be gained through oppression. Instead, it shows that the best solution lies in an world where everyone has equal opportunities to pursue their aspirations. This is symbolised by Ken\\'s transformation into an authentic version of himself, shedding the confines of the \"Beach Ken\" stereotype. Similarly, \"Stereotypical Barbie\" is portrayed as lacking resonance with genuine womanhood. In essence, the film advocates for a world where individuality flourishes, irrespective of gender, and where empowerment is rooted in authenticity rather than conforming to the roles society puts on us.To summarise, the Barbie movie is more than it\\'s surface interpretations and works to show an exploration of power dynamics, oppression, and societal roles. Its portrayal of characters and their transformations serves as a mirror to the complexity of real-world issues, ultimately advocating for a society where real empowerment stems from embracing individuality and fostering equal opportunities for all.To people who think the Barbie movie casts a negative light on men and depicts them as weak, it\\'s important to recognise that the film\\'s intention is not to generalise or demean masculinity, just as much as it works to dismantle toxic elements of femininity. While certain aspects of the movie might seem critical of traditional gender roles, its deeper message speaks the complexities of power dynamics and societal expectations that affect everyone. The movie\\'s portrayal of characters like Ken undergoing transformation and introspection is not about condemning masculinity, but rather an exploration of the pressures society places on individuals to conform to predefined roles. By engaging with the film in this broader context, it becomes evident that it aims to foster understanding and empathy, rather than to vilify masculinity as a whole.', 'Barbie is a really refreshing movie! Directed with a truly unique style that brings the Barbie universe to life, it tackles deep topics (gender issues, consumerism...) with a lot of humor. It opens a lot of interesting conversations in a very new way, switching perspectives to let the viewer experience the irony of the world we live in today.The only downside is that you have to close those doors, and that leads to a more cliche/expected wrap up of the story that takes away some of the uniqueness brought by the movie.Overall, a very recommended watch and a guilty pleasure for years to come!', 'I never would have gone to see this movie if it weren\\'t for a friend showing up to a party and telling me that it was a masterpiece. She described it as high art, which to me is high praise. After seeing it, I agree. It has all of the qualities of high art in that it is bound to be confusing to some, interpreted differently, and will inspire great feelings positive and negative depending on the viewer.Barbie gives you every opportunity to come in thinking you will be getting the silly quirky female equivalent of the Marvel universe. Vapid problems, absurdity, boys, and a classical formulaic movie arc. And it some ways it does keep to that.But all of those things are overshadowed by the philosophical discussion taking place. The director shows two worlds in juxtaposition: The Barbie Universe and the real world in present day. Matriarchy and Patriarchy.By removing a sense of consequence from the lives and decisions of the characters from the Barbie universe, it instead is able to engage on the philosophical level. A good comparison is \\'The Good Place.\\' Characters don\\'t have to act or respond realistically, instead characters respond thoughtfully and in accordance with the philosophical archetypes they represent.The Barbie universe is made to be perfect for the women that run that society, the Kens are riddled with need for validation. They hold no power of their own and Barbies have no incentive to share it.Through some plot vehicles, Barbie and Ken come to the real world. In one of the most important scenes of the film, Barbie and Ken walk down Venice Beach arriving from their strange plastic universe. For the first time the ultimately empowered Barbie is ogled and cat-called and made to feel unsafe, and the ultimately disempowered Ken is made to feel respected just for being alive.I think this specific scene is really important because it\\'s at the center of understanding the context for modern feminism. The simple difference between navigating walking down the street as a woman vs a man. Our world feels qualitatively different depending on who we are. Our feelings of safety and security in the public can differ wildly depending on what body we inhabit.Cheekily, the film is made for the female gaze. All men in the film are shown as being vapid and thoughtless both in the Barbie universe and the real world. I feel that this was an intentional decision to cause feelings of discomfort in men that watch. It serves to both flip the standard movie script (that has been improving in recent years) where it has been normal for female characters to be accessories to a plot and eye-candy for the male viewer and not ends in themselves, and also to make similarities between male viewers and Ken sting a bit. As a male viewer and musician I felt a painful twinge when Ken says \"let me play music at you\" It caused me to wonder how much space I take up socially with my music, and aware of how playing music when it\\'s not expressly desired can have a way of shutting down vulnerable conversation. Similarly the depictions of male to male empowerment felt familiar caricatures with a grain of truth to them.As the conflict ends and Barbie world returns to Matriarchy the film ends on a thoughtful tone. In both worlds the subjugated sex needs to fight for power being ungenerously allotted to them by the ruling sex. With a clear message that nobody wants either of these worlds, that in discarding the feelings of the unempowered denizens of our world we create a weak foundation, that true acceptance and understanding of these issues comes from letting in our full mortal nature and the realities that come with being human. That being messy, complex, and sexual beings is what gives meaning to this world and what is called for in any conversation on equality and class disparity.Despite our expectations, Barbie, isn\\'t dumb. It reflects a lot of thought and understanding of the current moment. It uses archetypes and simple forms to discuss real issues in the zeitgeist today. It discusses the problems with Barbie as a brand, with some formulations of feminism, with patriarchical society and what is does to women\\'s understandings of themselves.Barbie represents an awareness that far surpasses anybody\\'s expectations of the intellectual property it represents, and is worth the uncomfortable and somewhat depressing nature of the film for the dialog it opens up.', 'What distinguishes this film from many other blockbusters is the fact that the film is an original film. Greta Gerwig is mastermind behind this idea. Although the film is completely different from her other works with its \"doll-like\" performance of the main characters, too bright colors and a certain surrealism, her message is still visible, especially in the story. The film can also be called a coming-of-age story, which in many ways is what her previous works are. After all, at the beginning of the story, Barbie is a child, but simply in the body of an adult woman, and at the end she is already a real adult. Greta Gerwig is a true genius who was able to tell the story of a children\\'s doll, but in an adult way and with reflections and death, freedom, justice and much more. And besides, she did it incredibly beautifully and with excellent musical accompaniment, which is typical of her works.This is the perfect movie to watch with your family, your loved one, or just alone. There is a place to laugh or even be sad. The film is clearly worthy of your attention.', \"This movie was everything that was expected of it. It was funny, feministic, cute, beautiful and everything plastic. It was probably expected by many that the movie would be very superficial and focus more on the fun side of barbie, but it surprised us. This movie took a deep dive into what it is to be a girl and a woman in today's society and in the patriarchal world we live in today. It also brought into daylight the problematic history surrounding the plastic doll with many humorous elements. The only thing that brought this film down from a 10/10 was that it was everything we expected, and was missing a surprising plot twist. All in all I really recommend to watch this movie, it was a wonderful experience in the cinema!\", \"I really enjoyed the satirical approach that was employed in Barbie. It poked fun at Barbie World but, also delivers a message of empowerment and individuality. I laughed and was throughly entertained. It's a great movie for mothers and their tween, teen or adult daughters.I would recommend this movie to anyone that played with Barbies and Kens. It explored and poked fun at all aspects of the Barbie universe: Mattel, Barbie's perfect life and appreance, Barbie's many professions, Ken's dependency on Barbie, Patriarchy, Feminism, Barbie and Ken's clothes, their houses, cars, their fake food, pools, water, beaches, what happens to dolls that get mistreated. It's a great movie! Well done!\", 'It strikes generational emotional strings, the grace and charm reflected in honing in a clean performance. Delight to watch, and it will make you laugh and cry.The mystique of mixing cultures and making people laugh was phenomenal.The performances by Margot Robbie and new faces the supporting cast are all stunning. Support team Margot andthe extendable those who decided to play the other roles, in something so complex for the satisfaction of an entire world.The soundtrack should have been better articulated. Some of the songs are forgettable. Choreography is also a bit lacking and bad...', \"Very good felt like it dragged a but at the end for me which brings the marks down. But overall a very good film with good and enjoyable characters and plot line. Good aspects of comedy in some moments with a good soundtrack to partner with the film. I enjoyed the scenes in barbie land the most but that's not to say the scenes in the real world weren't enjoyable. It wasn't what I expected it to be in a good way. It clearly didn't have a mainly child audience which made it a lot more enjoyable. I loved watching how barbie and Ken adapted to the real world compared to barbie land and how mainly reacted to things that she can't do in barbie land like drinking.\", \"In this movie, I cried, laughed, had deep thoughts... I consider myself a big fan of the soundtrack, and i absolutely loved the story, characters, topic etc. I found the touch to feminism extremely reflecting our society, and I recommend this movie for anyone who- anyone, just anyone. This is a movie that will change people's minds and educate children while being a fun movie with an interesting plot! I definitely want to watch it again, since time flew by so quickly while watching this masterpiece, this amazing film that really made me leave the hall in tears. Please, if you haven't already, I recommend you to go watch it immediately.\", \"Spoilers (sort of)Barbie is something most of us grew up around in some form of fashion whether we played with them with our sisters, stole them when she wasn't looking, or hated them and stuck to our Hot Wheels and Gi Joe's. In this instance, Barbie is not the same Barbie we played with but a woman who is comfortable with complacency and is forced to fight the patriarchy while also find her purpose.From the set, to the costumes, Barbie did a wonderful job of bringing us into the world of Barbieland and reminding us of what the houses and cars used to look like (and how she was just a little too big for everything). Sure there was some dialogue that was aloof and in need of some reworking, and Ken's character was multi faceted ? But nontheless, it had a powerful two fold message to deliver.Barbie is a film that has been so hyped up by the public and it's duality of opening at the same time as Oppenheimer that you can't help but want to see it to stay in the cultural loop. At the same time, Barbie takes what should have been an entirely superficial script and goes just below the surface to remind us of our humanity, the world we built, and our opportunity for self determination. Personally, I think this was a brilliant way to engage moviegoers and a great way to disembark from the surface level franchise films many of us are accustomed to watching. It's comedic and relevant quips and nods entertained while it's double message challenged audiences to think critically about our world and their own places in it.While I am not surprised by the out of place moments (this is a Hollywood movie after all), I was pleasantly taken back by the journey we went on with stereotypical Barbie and her discovery of what it means to have free will. I highly suggest seeing this at least once, and with your mom if you can.\", 'Because of some reviews I thought that the movie was bad and innapropriate. But when I saw it I got shocked with the important and deep subjects that the movie talked about, and at the same time, I enjoyed the way that they talked about those sensitive subjects. I liked the way that they the movie had sad partes but that were funny and I liked the way that even when things were serious, they put them in an hilarious way.I enjoyed the end, because it ended up well to Ken and to Barbie, and everyone got happy.I hope that Ken finds his person and I would really like a continuation of this movie.', \"Wasn't sure how it would go however so much funnier then i expected, and definitely more of an adult film then i expected too, thought it was going to be aimed at the barbie loving 4 year olds however lots of laugh's throughout both jokes and other little subtle jokes like the CEO with his pink drum sticks and not being able to get through the locked gate with his swipe card as Barbie hops over the top and loved how it flipped between Barbie world and the normal world. Would highly recommend and would totally go back and see again and buy once out. Loved how everyone also gets in barbie theme and go dressed in pink.\", \"Initially I wasnt so sure about how this movie would be, and whether it would overly focus on the idea of a Barbie doll, stopping it from extending to a resonant deep meaning. However, I was quickly proven wromg as we see the procession of Barbies life going from 'perfect' to 'realistic' showing us that we really are similar, makimg the movie much more pleasurable (in my eyes) and allowimg us to connect with her, them going to the human world and Ken going back with new ideas further related the movie to the real world as we felt some level of pity for Ken as he had been forced to feel this way for so long but also felt anger and confuaion as to why he was ruining this perfecr world woth clearly dysfunctional ideas, given that he knew how it felt. The ending was very satisfying as it brought closure to the topic at hand and also taught audiences a true lesson about society and the world generally, elevating it from a simple childish movie, without sacrificing the barbie feel with the various, sprinkles whimsical and funny moments which acted as a reset for the tone, without causing you to forget what had happened! A very good movie with a strong, well delivered message.\", 'I\\'m one of those. But, I have many others in my life, who I work with and live with, and so it was great to view the world through their eyes for a couple hours and get my head around issues that impact them. It was a funny and entertaining movie. Just go to it aware that there\\'s quite a bit of sociological dialogue. America Ferrera\\'s soliloquy in the middle of the movie was powerful and would have been, IMO, more powerful if it hadn\\'t been surrounded by so many others like it before and after. But the issues are complex and could not possibly be \"covered\" by just one scene, so that\\'s understandable. It feels good to be heard, and there\\'s a lot to hear here but nothing for men to fear. The one thing I did not like was when one male character \"admitted\" that we (men) do a better job hiding the patriarchy in modern times. C\\'mon. Has there been progress or not? That statement creates distrust and erases good will. There\\'s been progress... yay! We need more progress... okay, let\\'s go!', 'Well barbie (2023) movie actually out of my expectation, i know barbie always been supporting feminist but this time barbie movie showing us how being feminist without even makes men feels underestimated. So, the whole plot was perfectly wrapped by good spices and well-written.And i\\'m so happy miss Gretta had chosen Margot Robbie as Barbie, her face and body just like living Barbie. Despite on that, we understand that barbie always been so perfect but in this movie barbie was written as \"just like us\" and Margot perfectly suit into this character also Ryan Gosling as Ken, His character is so funny and i really enjoyed it.', \"I agree that the film is contrary to the feminist narrative. So much so that in Barbieland women rule everything and Barbie didn't want to stay there at the end of the movie, preferring real life. The men of Barbilândia, built by women, were useless and bananas, without an 'I'. This is dealt with in one of the final scenes.I thought the film brought up very deep reflections that people didn't understand. According to the film, the world of patriarchy is imperfect and so is the feminist world.The scenes of Ken declaring himself to Barbie are reminiscent of poets and their muses. At no point does he make an apology for ideology...The film is intelligent with impeccable performances.\", '\"SUBLIME!\"Barbie is so much fun!! The set design is awesome, SO much creativity and color! Kens introduction is hilarious. Everything in Barbieland is wonderful. The music is perfect, Billie Eilish thank you for making me cry.America Ferrera, Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are all great. Gosling as Ken is probably my favorite casting in recent memory. Every cast member pulls their weight (except for one Ken.)I feel so good walking out of this movie every time, so encouraged and inspired. I love the story, the ending is profound. I really think this movie is perfect in every way. You don\\'t have to be perfect every day and you don\\'t have to be extraordinary, you can just be you!! Also, I can relate to finding my identity in a girl, and I really liked that Barbie and Ken had a conversation about finding yourself. \"Maybe it\\'s Ken, and it\\'s Barbie.\" I LOOOOVE that. Don\\'t get me started on the montage at the end of the movie, just beautiful stuff.Greta Gerwig doesn\\'t miss and she deserves all the success that comes from this movie, I can\\'t wait to see what she does next!!', \"The Barbie movie CHANGED my life. It really flipped a switch in my brain that men DO really just want girls ! Nothing more. And you are worth more than that. You ARE all that, and a man's validation does not have to tell you so. Theyre right, barbie is everything and ken is just ken ! Who knew after everything everyone told me i'm worth more than i know, the barbie movie is what did it. I LOVE this movie.Although, i did expect the ending to be a rather more happy one, i dont know why but i imagined an ending where they were dancing just like the start of the movie wouldve been so great (i loved that scene!!!). And since its audience is more likely children, i visioned an alternate ending to the movie as it would've been a little easier for them to comprehend. But as a young adult i completely love the movie, all of the actors did a perfect job as their characters. Last but not least, i did almost manage to shed a tear :') (but i held it in because my mum was there haha)\", 'In this unexpected cinematic journey, \"Barbie\" takes a seemingly simple premise-a movie based on a kids\\' toy-and ventures into surprisingly profound territory. As a casual viewer, I found myself immersed in a tapestry of classic movie references woven seamlessly throughout the film. While some nods might have eluded me, I couldn\\'t help but appreciate the directorial finesse in incorporating influences from cinematic legend Stanley Kubrick. These nods operated on both an artistic and nostalgic level, striking a chord with audiences of different backgrounds.The film\\'s narrative commences with a robust start, drawing viewers into its vibrant world. However, I must admit that the conclusion seemed to lose some of its initial impact. Nevertheless, the overall experience was enjoyable, taking me and my family on an entertaining ride. Speaking of family, watching it with my wife and two sons added an enriching dynamic to the experience.Interestingly, the film defies convention by tackling thought-provoking themes that resonate with older audiences. My eldest son, at the tender age of ten, astutely observed the movie\\'s poignant reflection on the fragility of life, encapsulated in its exploration of anxiety, depression, and mental health. Such profound subjects might fly over the heads of younger viewers, leaving them with a cheerful and colorful impression of the film. However, those of us inclined to ponder deeper meanings will uncover layers beyond what we\\'d typically anticipate from a movie based on a kids\\' toy.The comedic elements, particularly those featuring the talented Will Ferrell, added to the film\\'s overall charm, though I\\'d refrain from labeling them exceptional. For me, the true allure lay in the film\\'s willingness to embrace darker themes, which lent it an intriguing edge. Comparing it to \"Rick and Morty\" instead of \"Super Mario Bros\" feels more apt, highlighting the movie\\'s unexpected depth and complexity.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" is a fascinating cinematic endeavor that defies preconceived notions. While rooted in a kids\\' toy, the film boldly delves into thought-provoking subjects, inviting a diverse audience to partake in its unexpected layers. Whether you\\'re in it for the nostalgic references, the comedic interludes, or the contemplative exploration of life\\'s complexities, \"Barbie\" manages to leave an impression that\\'s both delightful and introspective.', \"At the beginning of the film, Barbieworld is run by women (Barbies), which reflects the real life Barbie dolls that have all sorts of jobs like doctor, scientist, etc.At the end of the film, the Barbies realise that matriarchy is wrong by getting a taste of their own medicine and so men (Kens) in Barbieworld start being allowed to have jobs and positions of power alongside the women.This is why the Barbie movie is a film about true gender equality. Heavy handed like many popular Hollywood films but great message. Anyone who doesn't believe that Barbie isn't a multifaceted woman hasn't been paying attention for the past few decades. Silly billies.\", 'Great movie. Great casting. Margot Robbie as barbie is just beautiful and Ryan Gosling as ken is just amazing. A fresh movie with humour and sarcasm directly on society. Watch only if you can handle the tone of sarcasm. Ending can be confusing, it depends on your view, I was expecting rather different ending that maybe baribe would go other way but it is subjective. Watch if you want to experience a fresh sarcasm blast on thinking on society. At some point it feels like the points are targeted at only one person but it is not.Beauty of Margot is really amazing. It is truly amazing to watch her as barbie.', 'After seeing the movie twice, I think that a solid 8/10 is a fair rating for it. Not going to lie, I was very hyped for this movie for a long time and it did not disappoint. I think all of the bad reviews are really just people who did not understand it LOL the movie is most definitely not anti-men. I don\\'t want to spoil it but, if anything, the ultimate message is very wholesome. The movie is funny and, by far, my favorite parts included the Kens (couldn\\'t get \"I\\'m Just Ken\" out of my head for days afterwards).With that being said, my main criticism comes from the fact that it is kind of ironic that the movie is basically a 1,5 hr long commercial (to those of you who have seen it, remember Sasha\\'s rant). The message is still good and I enjoyed the movie but, ultimately, it is a commercial. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack but imo the song at the credits just did not fit in and honestly shouldn\\'t have been made.', \"BARBIE was the pink surprise everyone needed, it's empowering and humorous. I would watch it ten more times and laugh every time. I would change one direction or another for some characters, but even what I didn't like when seen together with these well-written plots and accurate jokes is almost invisible. It was fun, beautiful and very enjoyable at all times, the cast's performance is electrifying Ryan Gosling is a humorous and talented genius and Margot Robbie she is as nice and beautiful as Barbie should be. The soundtrack is beautiful and as compatible as it needs to be. Someone give an award to the visual and artistic director of this film he deserves it.\", \"I just finished watching Barbie and I have to say, it was absolutely amazing! The perfect blend of humor, cuteness, and emotion really made the film stand out. The message was conveyed flawlessly and it had a big impact on me. It also brought back some great memories from my childhood. All of the details on the houses, the dialogues, and the clothes were so impressive that they really added to the overall experience. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were absolutely brilliant in their performances and Ken's act had me laughing non-stop! This movie is definitely a masterpiece. I must say, good job, Greta! I only gave it 9 out of 10 because I wish it could have been a bit longer.\", \"The movie was fun and all and It was horrible the way kens treated barbies I mean I also see how they have been treated by Barbies but they have got too far I also loved when she met that old lady that came with her as an idea in the company and it was funny when she spilled the tea all over herself,furthermore the intro was so hilarious the way those little young (girls\\\\boys) destroyed the baby dolls,in addition I would say that I think the end was kind of bittersweet when she stopped being Barbie and moved to the real world to live with people as Barbara,It's an excvellent movie to watch alone or with family and friends.\", \"Barbie is a film that stands out by defying initial assumptions, proving that it is not just a silly or ironic production. On the contrary, it remarkably addresses important themes with a lightness and clarity that are truly impressive. The storyline delves into subjects such as self-esteem, the value of friendship, and the significance of persevering in the pursuit of one's dreams. Barbie, the main character, emerges as a role model of strength and determination for young viewers, encouraging them to believe in themselves and face challenges with a smile. Furthermore, the film's high-quality animations and captivating soundtrack contribute to a visually and musically gratifying experience. Barbie pleasantly surprises audiences with its positive message, conveyed in an accessible and enjoyable manner.\", \"I saw Barbie yesterday. It was surprisingly good. I think they did as well as they can with the source material. It's a little smarter than you expect they bring attention to a lot of societal issues still all surface level stuff though they were not discussed in a super meaningful way. However it's more than enough given the audience and kids should be learning a little bit about that stuff because it's important. It's full of a lot of emotion and great acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin. These two were great and probably the best I've ever seen them act. Movie also has a great message and lessons which is a plus these days when all movies are is just special effects, remakes, and franchises. It was enjoyable and entertaining. However it did not feature the song Barbie Girl by Aqua so 0/10.\", 'The jokes are entertaining and the movie has the just correct amount of dramatic storyline to make it more than an empty comedy.The repetitive use of patriarchy is rather in the movie because it to wants to make sure that everyone understands the message and not because it thinks men = bad and woman = good. Already after the first 30 minutes the message is super clear and thats where it gets a bit empty. It fights so much against stereotypical masculinity, consumerism and capitalism but still puts a 4 minutes long chevrolet commercial (which screams how rugged the brand is) in the movie that entirely destroys the credibility of the movie.']\n",

       "      <td>Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.</td>\n",

Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!</td>\n",

       "      <td>As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.</td>\n",

I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men.

And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.   \n",
       "1                                                                                                                                                                              The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!   \n",

I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.   \n",
       "3  I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.   \n",

The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.   \n",

All of the details on the houses, the dialogues, and the clothes were so impressive that they really added to the overall experience. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were absolutely brilliant in their performances and Ken's act had me laughing non-stop! This movie is definitely a masterpiece. I must say, good job, Greta!

On the contrary, it remarkably addresses important themes with a lightness and clarity that are truly impressive. The storyline delves into subjects such as self-esteem, the value of friendship, and the significance of persevering in the pursuit of one's dreams. Barbie, the main character, emerges as a role model of strength and determination for young viewers, encouraging them to believe in themselves and face challenges with a smile.

However it's more than enough given the audience and kids should be learning a little bit about that stuff because it's important. It's full of a lot of emotion and great acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin. These two were great and probably the best I've ever seen them act. Movie also has a great message and lessons which is a plus these days when all movies are is just special effects, remakes, and franchises. It was enjoyable and entertaining.

Already after the first 30 minutes the message is super clear and thats where it gets a bit empty. It fights so much against stereotypical masculinity, consumerism and capitalism but still puts a 4 minutes long chevrolet commercial (which screams how rugged the brand is) in the movie that entirely destroys the credibility of the movie.</td>\n",

       "905                                                                                                                                   I just finished watching Barbie and I have to say, it was absolutely amazing! The perfect blend of humor, cuteness, and emotion really made the film stand out. The message was conveyed flawlessly and it had a big impact on me. It also brought back some great memories from my childhood. All of the details on the houses, the dialogues, and the clothes were so impressive that they really added to the overall experience. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were absolutely brilliant in their performances and Ken's act had me laughing non-stop! This movie is definitely a masterpiece. I must say, good job, Greta! I only gave it 9 out of 10 because I wish it could have been a bit longer.   \n",

       "907  Barbie is a film that stands out by defying initial assumptions, proving that it is not just a silly or ironic production. On the contrary, it remarkably addresses important themes with a lightness and clarity that are truly impressive. The storyline delves into subjects such as self-esteem, the value of friendship, and the significance of persevering in the pursuit of one's dreams. Barbie, the main character, emerges as a role model of strength and determination for young viewers, encouraging them to believe in themselves and face challenges with a smile. Furthermore, the film's high-quality animations and captivating soundtrack contribute to a visually and musically gratifying experience. Barbie pleasantly surprises audiences with its positive message, conveyed in an accessible and enjoyable manner.   \n",
       "908       I saw Barbie yesterday. It was surprisingly good. I think they did as well as they can with the source material. It's a little smarter than you expect they bring attention to a lot of societal issues still all surface level stuff though they were not discussed in a super meaningful way. However it's more than enough given the audience and kids should be learning a little bit about that stuff because it's important. It's full of a lot of emotion and great acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin. These two were great and probably the best I've ever seen them act. Movie also has a great message and lessons which is a plus these days when all movies are is just special effects, remakes, and franchises. It was enjoyable and entertaining. However it did not feature the song Barbie Girl by Aqua so 0/10.   \n",
       "909                                                                                                                                                                        The jokes are entertaining and the movie has the just correct amount of dramatic storyline to make it more than an empty comedy.The repetitive use of patriarchy is rather in the movie because it to wants to make sure that everyone understands the message and not because it thinks men = bad and woman = good. Already after the first 30 minutes the message is super clear and thats where it gets a bit empty. It fights so much against stereotypical masculinity, consumerism and capitalism but still puts a 4 minutes long chevrolet commercial (which screams how rugged the brand is) in the movie that entirely destroys the credibility of the movie.   \n",
